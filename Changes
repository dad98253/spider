28Jul04=======================================================================
1. backported 'Investigate' from NP branch so that only pingable nodes
are 'believed'.
2. added missing entries in Internet.pm for sh/contest
26Jul04=======================================================================
1. added extra variables to Internet.pm to allow the various internet query
commands to alter the url that they use. 
2. Added show/425 command from Leo, IZ5FSA.
05Jul04=======================================================================
1. fix rspfcheck on pc27
23Jun04=======================================================================
1. Add zone, by_zone, itu, by_itu, state and by_state searches to sh/dx
2. Update manuals for CVS and new commands
22Jun04=======================================================================
1. Add the show/mydx command which *may* filter your spots using your
spot filter.
17Jun04=======================================================================
1. alter processing of PC17 to see if they get distributed more than now.
14Jun04=======================================================================
1. fix previous fix of sh/dx
09Jan04=======================================================================
1. removed PC90 which was breaking various filtering things.
2. added realtime spot formats to sh/dx (at least in basic form), this is
activated by using either of the keywords 'real' of 'rt' on the command
line. Also added sh/fdx as an alias.
01Jan04=======================================================================
1. move position of USDB init to get rid of an obscure bug pointed out by
Charlie K1XX.
2. Remove redundant documentation
31Dec03=======================================================================
1. alter remote database handling to 'new standard'.
30Dec03=======================================================================
1. updated website to make it clear(er) that it all works under Windows (like
wot Charlie said...).
2. made the changes to the German Messages that Thomas DL3SBB sent me a 
loooong time ago.
3. made 'dx by' require at least privilege 1.
29Dec03=======================================================================
1. updated dxoldtonew.pl so that it takes an AK1A DX.DAT file (argument on
command line or a default of /spider/data/DX.DAT and outputs the standard
DXSpider format spot files. Please be warned that if any of these files 
already exist, the data will be appended onto the end of the file. Please
make sure you have backups or at least be aware that this may give strange
results which may be 'out of order'.
24May03=======================================================================
1. Added more french translations from Robert (HB9BZA) and we now have some
french help as well (also from Robert). A splendid effort. Thank you.
16May03=======================================================================
1. Correct Windows section of the Addendum file! (g0vgs)
06May03=======================================================================
1. Add Portuguese language courtesy of David CT1DRB (set/lang pt)
2. Add French language courtesy of Robert HB9BZA (set/lang fr)
02Apr03=======================================================================
1. Fix some minor problems with the manuals (g0vgs)
01Apr03=======================================================================
1. Update filtering primer, changes by N3RD (g0vgs)
28Mar03=======================================================================
1. Added an excellent document on filtering to the manuals from Jim, W3BG
2. started to remove old documents (g0vgs)
27Mar03=======================================================================
1. play around with sh/reg, sh/iso, sh/node and sh/lock to make them work
slightly better with the new user format.
2. update manuals (g0vgs)
26Mar03=======================================================================
1. add some ak1a compatibility changes to chat
2. added help text for chat, join, leave and sh/chat.
18Mar03=======================================================================
1. minor corrections to manuals (g0vgs)
17Mar03=======================================================================
1. changed the regex determining what is a callsign to be more comprehensive.
I would suggest re-running create_qsl.pl and then restarting.
2. Fix chat so that output appears to users again and PC sentence conforms
to standard. Add kludge to remove rewritten chats if I see them.
3. Only send chat PCs to spider or AK1A boxes
12Mar03=======================================================================
1. added HC and QRZ.com to possible QSL locations, if you want to pick up
historical info (ie start again), run create_qsl.pl after update and restart
the node (which you will need to do anyway).
2. changed the dbcreate command so that you can say: 
   dbcreate dxqsl cmd show/dxqsl
which will allow local and remote users to execute commands as though they
are Databases. You can also include these databases in chains. What you do
with this, is ofcourse a moot question.   
3. Update manuals (g0vgs)
11Mar03=======================================================================
1. Changed the name of show/qsl to show/dxqsl.
2. Alter Commands_en.hlp to match new name and issue manual updates (g0vgs)
10Mar03=======================================================================
1. added show/qsl command. This command basically takes the normal output of
sh/dx qsl and stores it in a database. In order to enable this command you 
will require the Storable module to be loaded (you will already have done
this with a bit of luck for the new DXUser interface). The suggested 
procedure is (after the update) to run /spider/perl/create_qsl.pl (this may
take a long time), then immediately it finishes, restart the node. The node 
will then keep the database up to date automatically. If you are not 
interested in historical data then you can leave this step out.
2. added show/contest command from Tommy SM3OSM via Rene OZ1LQH.
08Mar03=======================================================================
1. Added chat, join, leave commands to allow general purpose conferencing
on arbitrary subjects. [Translators: added e34,e35,join,leave]. There is
currently no help. There is also sh/chat.
28Feb03=======================================================================
1. Charlie K1XX fixed the sh/iso, sh/reg and sh/node commands
25Feb03=======================================================================
1. backported switch processing for PC sentences
24Feb03=======================================================================
1. add the 'run' command and the 'privilege' command to allow sysops to 
create scripts for people.
2. fix show/user so that it doesn't moan about uninitialised variables
23Feb03=======================================================================
1. Added show/wm7d command (a US only callbook server) [by K1XX].
2. Added a prototype show/db0sdx command (w.i.p).
3. Added set/dxcq and set/dxitu zone commands [Translators: I have added
dxcqu, dxcqs, dxitus and dxituu to Messages].
4. Add new Commands to manuals (g0vgs)
5. make sure that none of the above set/dx... commands are defaulted on
22Feb03=======================================================================
1. changed qrz.com address 
2. added Charlie's [K1XX] new wpxloc.raw data stuff to get WA1, KC3 type 
callsigns to work better.
3. added in set/usstate command which prints any US state information 
available on both the spotted (LHS of time) and spotter (RHS of time).
[Translators: I have added usstates and usstateu to Messages].
4. Merged in the new (faster) DXUser.pm.

[NOTE] this version will require Storable to be installed. On the
other hand the code may work without, in a compatible way. This bit hasn't 
been very well tested (the 'no Storable' condition that is). 

[*** NOTE ***] make sure that you do an 'export_user' BEFORE restarting
you node. (Yes I know this is like a shrinkwrap licence, but I can't
help it).

It will take several minutes for the node to restart when it does the 
conversion from .v2 to .v3 user file. Please go and have a good strong cup
of tea whilst this is happening.

If it fails then you will need to edit your latest user_asc file on (or about)
line 25 it says: $ref = decode($f[1]); you will need to change that to 
$ref = asc_decode($f[1]); and then do: perl user_asc
 
DO MAKE SURE THAT you include subdirectories in your CVS update 

21Feb03=======================================================================
1. moved the export of the users file to Wednesday night (GMT) to avoid 
possible crashes and/or delays during a contest weekend.
14Feb03=======================================================================
1. some major changes to the structure of the manual documentation.  To bring
the manuals into line, they now have the language tag (like 
installation_en.html).  Hopefully someone will translate the manuals 
eventually :-) I have left the old files in CVS for now to allow
everyone to change any symlinks etc to the new filenames.  I will remove the
old files shortly, please update your links! (g0vgs)
2. docs makefile updated and commands2sgml.pl added from M0AZM.  This script
inserts the helpfiles automagically from Commands_en.hlp into the relevant
manuals. (g0vgs)
3. Commands_en.hlp adjusted slightly to ensure at least one space before
examples for the purposes of the above script. (g0vgs)
4. Amend index.html to the right document names. (g0vgs)
09Feb03=======================================================================
1. Correct some typos in the manuals and update perl modules etc.  Also
amend some help files to show correct syntax, around the 'clear' commands
swapping [input] and <callsign> in each case, translators please take note.
Thanks to Dave N3RD for info. (g0vgs)
2. update the addendum for latest build and include information on additional
modules required. (g0vgs)
20Jan03=======================================================================
1. changed sh/c so that, by default, it only shows the caller's country nodes
sh/c all will show the old style full list. "sh/c sk gb" will show the config
of all the GB and SK nodes.
2. changed sh/stat and sh/route for nodes
19Jan03=======================================================================
1. I have made a fundemental change to the way PC19s are dealt with as a 
result of the discussions on the mailing list. From now on, only nodes that
issue PC16s will have PC19s propagated. If they *ever* issue a PC16 then from
then on they are considered as being 'connected' and thus routable. No PC16
and you have no route. This should stop all passive links being routed. For
the few cases where you know that that is a very small node and it rarely has
users, then you can do a set/routepc19 <node> to enable PC19 propagation. In
the even more rare case of you wanting to prevent PC19s being routed thru 
your node, you can use unset/routepc19. THIS IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR ROUTE
FILTERING!!!!! [translators: I have added wpc16s, wpc16u, wpc19s, wpc19u]

BTW the first time you connect again you will notice a separate PC19 go out
for each 'new' PC16 that the node sees. This is normal and will go away the
second time the system needs to issue a PC19.
2. Alter the export_user command to remove users that have no useful info
and have not been seen for more than (default) 1 year.
3. fix the problem of users on more than one node not being propagated
4. remove spaces and all non-US ascii characters from PC41 for the dup check.
5. put in check to see if the parent of a newly allowed PC19 is still there
(this needs further investigation).
17Jan03=======================================================================
1. Fix problem with lines being left in the main input queue for a 
disconnected/ing node.
14Jan03=======================================================================
1. Tidy up AUTOLOAD functions
2. Make sure that empty PC16s are not sent on startup to a node.
12Jan03=======================================================================
1. add Czech language courtesy of Milan OK1XH
06Jan03=======================================================================
1. add the latest changes to the spider-web java interface from Rene, OZ1LQH.
Please note that there is a change to the spider.cgi file this time so that
the client show 'Connected to Node_Call' instead of the hostname.  You will
need to update your cgi file when you update the changes.  Please make sure
that you back up your old files first! (g0vgs)
2. yet more changes to the java client from Rene :-)  Also added a makefile
and a Changes file for the client in the spider-web directory.
05Jan03=======================================================================
1. fix some irritating messages caused by protocol loops in sh/c
2. update copyright
3. move GN from GJ to GI
31Dec02=======================================================================
1. Update files in the java client with fixes and additions from Rene, OZ1LQH
05Dec02=======================================================================
1. Fix SSID issues with AGWMsg.
2. updated show/hftable, vhftable, hfstats, vhfstats and dxstats after K1XX
sent in some sample code indicated new functionality he requires. Translators
please note that the stat* messages have been changed and e33 added. I have 
also added quite a bit of extra examples and things to the relevant HELP
texts. It is now possible to search from any date for up to 365 days of data.
You can get the information by prefix or by callsign or for ALL spots. 
04Dec02=======================================================================
1. updated sh/log to allow searching for more arbitrary strings such as IP
addresses
08Nov02=======================================================================
1. update Keps.pm to reflect which satellites now come round in the weekly
updates. I suggest that you copy this file to /spider/local and do a load/kep
and you should lose all the 'old' satellites (eg MIR).
08Nov02=======================================================================
1. made some small mods to grepdbg and spot2csv.pl
2. fix a possible DOS in dx command
07Nov02=======================================================================
1. allow three digit longitudes
2. make a small change to see if messages now stay in place.
3. make keep actually stick over a reboot and take it fully into account for
deletions (translators: I added m18).
4. try not to delete new messages (even if this is an update that reads 'old'
messages with missing fields).
29Oct02=======================================================================
1. make sh/log et al a bit more efficient.
2. fix dupe message in dx.
3. update cty.dat to the latest, add k8T, K8O to KH8 and TX5BTY to FO/A
4. clear cache on reload of prefixes
25Oct02=======================================================================
1. remove the dupefile automatically if it becomes corrupted
2. instrument the startup slightly more
21Oct02=======================================================================
1. Fix msg aging.
2. make the default pinginterval and obscount variable (set/var 
$DXProt::pingint and $DXProt::obscount) 
20Oct02=======================================================================
1. remove dupe check on local sysop announces
2. fix format errors on sh/muf for 5.8.0
3. add new version of the administration manual that includes WinCVS with
thanks to K1XX (g0vgs).
17Oct02=======================================================================
1. added new Spanish files for help and Messages from Angel, EA7WA.
16Oct02=======================================================================
1. decrease the default max length of PC16/19 to around 180 characters to be
slightly friendlier to ARC, which seems to have a difficulty reconstructing
lines from multiple packets. Also make the value settable via set/var.
2. strip off blank spaces from the ends of lines of  command output.
15Oct02=======================================================================
1. made some detail changes to the raw USDB data and the routines that 
generate and operate on them. There were some bugs involving a few 'missing'
callsigns which been fixed. Also there were some, for our purposes, invalid
callsigns in the database which have been removed (down to about 820,000 
entries now). You should really update your database. 

The latest code now (conditionally; ie if you have it loaded it will use it)
support Compress::Zlib on both *nux and Windows. The suggested procedure 
is this:-

1. Download the corrected database from
   http://www.dxcluster.org/download/usdbraw.gz to somewhere like /tmp.
2. update from CVS.
3. Restart (on linux, just stop the node and *don't* restart on Windows).
4. remove /spider/data/usdb.v1
5. cd /spider/perl
6. (perl) create_usdb.pl /tmp/usdbraw.gz (or wherever you put it)
6a. If you don't have Compress::Zlib loaded then you will need to gunzip
    it manually and do: create_usdb.pl /tmp/usdbraw (not Windows :-)
7. on linux, in a console window do: load/usdb, on windows: restart the node. 
--
2. Added set/usdb command to add adding or changing of a callsign in the USDB
3. Stop dupe spots from the same spotter (with or without comment corruption)
14Oct02=======================================================================
1. added show/usdb command as a simple, direct interface to the information
available in the USDB stuff.
13Oct02=======================================================================
1. A large change has occurred. There is now some (optional) US state recog-
nition. This is in its early stages but appears to work for me. You will need
to :-

1. download the database at http://www.dxcluster.org/download/usdbraw.gz 
2. save it somewhere (/tmp, anywhere).
3. Decompress it using your favorite program (gunzip / winzip) [call it
   usdbraw if winzip]{BE WARNED, some browsers may decompress it on the
   fly for you, you can tell; if it is 5Mb it is compressed - 16Mb not}.
4. remove any /spider/data/user.v1 files lying around (at least for this
   first time.
5. cd /spider/perl
6. perl create_usdb.pl /tmp/usdbraw  (ie the UNCOMPRESSED file)
7. Wait, I suggest some cups of tea are in order.
8. Wait a bit more.

You don't need Compress::Zlib anymore, I assumed it was universal.

You will be able do this while the node is running somewhen. There is a 
planned method of keeping the US DB up to date with smaller (ie < 15Mb) patch
files once a week but you will have to wait a bit for the code to bed down 
first. You can filter on routes, spots and announces using 'call_state' or
'by_state' and a comma separated list of state codes. The HELP has been 
updated (which may help...). 

Once you have run the create_usdb.pl you will need to restart.

If you don't need this, then don't run create_usdb.pl it will simply be
a waste of time. The run-time version is 30Mb and has 840,000 odd entries
in it. This does not replace or supplant sh/qrz (sorry Charlie [who put me
up to this]). 

2. There are a number of other niff-naff changes which I hope will improve
rather than hinder your user experience (including check forward as well as
back for those speedy clocked dupes mentioned below).  
12Oct02=======================================================================
1. attempt to improve the "check back for 5 minutes to see if this spot is 
the same as a previous one but for the time spotted" dupe check.
2. improve the sh/vhftable and sh/hftable commands to allow you to enquire
by dxcc country (using the relevant prefixes or dxcc country numbers).
[note to translators, I have changed the help text and Messages tags for
stat*].
07Oct02=======================================================================
1. fix problem with (invalid) callsigns starting with '0' (zero) eg 0f6ira.
03Oct02=======================================================================
1. only sysop (priv=5+) can now send to distro SYSOP, ordinary users will have 
their message routed to the $main::myalias callsign as a private message. 
29Sep02=======================================================================
1. Added LRU caching to DXUsers and Prefix.
2. make Timer::handler only search its chain once a second seeing as that
is the minimum granularity available.
3. add some separation between cfg file making, data generation and mrtg 
running. See /spider/cmd/mrtg.pl for some instructions...
4. Added data in and out to the MRTG stats, you need to do an indexmaker
to get them onto the index page, I have also added some colour to the
legend to make what is being displayed a bit more obvious.

See http://gb7djk.dxcluster.org/mrtg/stats.html for an example of the
default screen.

28Sep02=======================================================================
1. Put some transparent caching into Prefix.pm to see if this has a 
performance impact.
2. Fix doing a new log open for every log file write.
26Sep02=======================================================================
1. added WWV and WCY to the Mrtg stats. Don't forget to do an indexmaker!
25Sep02=======================================================================
1. added mrtg stuff to the system as a template. In order to use this you
must install mrtg onto your system and copy all the mrtg files (or at least
all the images) to new directory /spider/html/mrtg. The system generates the
config file for you as part of its workings. To get it to update add a line
to your spider crontab like: 

00,05,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * run_cmd('mrtg all')

You will also need to do an indexmaker once in the html directory. I put the 
index page into /spider/html/mrtg/stats.html YMMV. I do:

indexmaker --output stats.html --columns=1 --title "MRTG statistics for 
GB7DJK" ../../mrtg/mrtg.cfg

But all on one line.
2. I have made a technical change to the way ax25 connects outward on unix 
boxes are done. I currently have no way of testing this. I think it still 
works.
22Sep02=======================================================================
1. Add changes to the installation manual for Windows users from K1XX
21Sep02=======================================================================
1. make some detail changes for connects out in Msg.pm
17Sep02=======================================================================
1. Added shu command for Charlie's (K1XX) benefit (together with the rest of
our butterfingered sysops) who miss the '/' out of sh/u frequently enough 
to curse. 'shu' simply types out a message saying 'type SHUT' to shutdown the
node. Added 'shu' to /spider/perl/Messages. No need to restart, just 
load/mess and load/alias after doing a CVS.
21Aug02=======================================================================
1. added 'warc' and 'contesthf' to the regions in bands.pl (K1XX).
20Aug02=======================================================================
1. fix lines containing just the character '0' in messages (and console.pl)
(K1XX).
2. remove all newline characters from AGW data, thus treating it like a 
'normal' ax25 connection where the 'newline' convention is just carriage
return (K1XX)
06Aug02=======================================================================
1. added 5.5Mhz band as '60m'.
29Jul02=======================================================================
1. Changed max R value in wcy to 500 from 300.
2. Got rid of warnings on startup using 5.8.0 
28Jul02=======================================================================
1. stick the invalid key deletes in an eval loop in export_user
18Jul02=======================================================================
1. Make additions and changes to manuals. (g0vgs)
16Jul02=======================================================================
1. Add changes to the spider-web java web client.  Thanks to Rene, OZ1LQH.  It
should now be easier to install and run for all systems. (g0vgs)
11Jul02=======================================================================
1. NP work has now started in ernest ([ed]who he?). You will need to download
Digest::SHA1 and any dependant packages to run this release. HOWEVER tempted
you are, please don't set/newprotocol on any nodes. It won't work.
http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Digest/Digest-SHA1-2.01.tar.gz
2. Make the cluster node registered on from startup (from Mark HB9DBM).
3. Make the 'export_users' process *MUCH* more robust. It should now accept
funny characters and not rely on an absolutely 'perfect' user file to work.
Errors are displayed (and logged if done from the cluster) and then ignored.
Invalid callsigns are removed. 
09Jul02=======================================================================
1. make the is_qra more accurate (from Mark HB9DBM).
04Jul02=======================================================================
1. added another fix to Prefix.pm so that it resolves Japan callsigns again
also you can 'set/debug prefix' to see what it is trying to do.
03Jul02=======================================================================
1. Added the DEMONSTRATE command which allows a sysop to demonstrate a 
command to a user (from a request by Charlie K1XX). 
2. added message e31 (xxxx is not a user)
02Jul02=======================================================================
1. Fixed the problem with badspotter or badnode being set to baddx if either
of the data files are missing. 
25Jun02=======================================================================
1. as predicted there was an error in the Prefix routine, I have improved it.
24Jun02=======================================================================
1. make set/badspotter non SSID sensitive. Set/badnode is left to be SSID
sensitive. 
2. added 3XA(=3X) and K1B(=KH1) also changed the logic of sh/prefix. This
may break things, please test it. 
19Jun02=======================================================================
1. make set/badspotter and set/badnode apply to announces and talks as well
as spots. 
12Jun02=======================================================================
1. fixed (un)set/wwv and (un)set/wcy so they don't issue spurious messages.
Thanks Rene (oz1lqh)
07Jun02=======================================================================
1. fix messages in DXDb.pm to point to the correct ones. Thanks Rene (oz1lqh)
2. add missing wcys and wcyu messages to Messages. Thanks Rene (again)
3. upissue version number to 1.50 (finally)
16Apr02=======================================================================
1. allow the rest of PC19 to continue if it contains a reference to a locally
connected node. Thank you Tommy SM3OSM.
19Mar02=======================================================================
1. fix problems with ephemeral dup checking on PC16,17,19,21
2. perturb the problem with national character sets.
15Mar02=======================================================================
1. add help for 'accept' and 'reject'. (g0vgs)
2. adjustments to the manuals (g0vgs)
3. make changes to reflect the correct output of sh/sun and sh/moon based
on information from Steve, K9AN. (g0vgs)
23Feb02=======================================================================
1. remove old satellites from keps.
2. Add information on setting up the ax25 utils to the installation manual
(g0vgs)
19Feb02=======================================================================
1. move the PC11 dup check after the input filter
06Feb02=======================================================================
1. changes to manuals to (hopefully) improve documentation and alter my email
address (g0vgs)
02Feb02=======================================================================
1. changed sh/qrz to the latest incarnation of the command at qrz.com.
29Jan02=======================================================================
1. add VP8GEO to South Georgia
27Jan02=======================================================================
1. make save work in cron context
2. try to get the C client to handle closes on its standard input better
3. put some validation in cluster.pl to check that people have set it up 
handled.
4. fix the long callsign checking
22Jan02=======================================================================
1. limit spot dupe checking to first 12 characters
13Jan02=======================================================================
1. changed the backstop termination alarm routing in the C client so that
it flushes the input and output buffer and then commits suicide.
12Jan02=======================================================================
1. put setsockopts into eval block to allow some of them to fail
11Jan02=======================================================================
1. Make M$ TCP connx blocking again, sigh...
2. backed out ALL the M$ speedup and make nicer changes :-(
3. cope with data coming in during the disconnection process. Don't worry
Earth people, this will take no longer than 15 of your Earth seconds...
10Jan02=======================================================================
1. set SO_LINGER = 0 to try to prevent the system sending data on a closing
socket. This MAY help some of the hanging problems (but I am now beginning
to doubt this).
2. do the same on the C client (which means DON'T FORGET to make it).
3. set no nagling on the output from the node.
4. set KEEPALIVE on TCP connections for both the node and C Client (you will
have to make the C client again) and you will need to restart.
5. It appears that it IS possible to set non blocking on M$ you just need to
know how.
6. Fix problem with load/cmd_cache core dumping the system
08Jan02=======================================================================
1. altered sh/qrz to point to the new server
2. alter the character set handling a bit to make it better for spanish
06Jan02=======================================================================
1. fix leading space removal from messages input from the keyboard
2. make some mods to allow perl 5.7.2 to run
3. create $DXProt::eph_restime to allow variable slugging of ephemeral dups
4. create $DXProt::eph_info_restime to allow a long dupe time for these
5. create $DXProt::eph_pc34 to allow a short anti dupe slug for rcmd loops
6. Add a new sysop cmd 'save' which will save the output of any command (or
list of commands in "<cmd>") to a file.
7. Add a new command "echo" which echos its argument to the screen (useful
for titling in the save command above.
8. Increase interval between logins causing for/opernam to 60 days (from 30)
+ a random factor between 0 and 9.
9. Added Italian translation of Messages from Luca IT9ROT (thank you 
very much).
10. Added the /<cmd> feature (as in talk) to execute a cmd whilst typing a 
message, then enhanced it so that if you do //sh/dx (for instance) it will
put the result into the message (as well as show it to you).
11. Added the // feature to talk as well. 
02Jan02=======================================================================
1. updated the copyright dates
2. modernised and extended the Windows instructions a bit.
3. added a TODO file which is the list of things that I need to do. Please
badger me to put YOUR enhancement on this list. It will then get done.
31Dec01=======================================================================
1. Make a couple of changes to the Installation Manual and add a FAQ on msg
deletion. (g0vgs)
2. Fix unset/register so it works (g0vgs)
30Dec01=======================================================================
1. make PC21 coming from the channel's node call then treat it as a PC39 and
disconnect it.
2. Send the client a 'Z' command (shutdown) to see if this has any effect on
the hangs.
26Dec01=======================================================================
1. make some detail changes to help texts
2. Added 'all' to the Band's region table to allow 'acc/spot on all/cw'
23Dec01=======================================================================
1. allow sh/dx on 1000/4000 (or 1000-4000).
2. merge sh/dx and sh/dxcc commands (Alias sh/dxcc to sh/dx dxcc). You can
now do things like 'sh/dxcc oq2 by w dxcc'. 
20Dec01=======================================================================
1. Fix 'not' in filtering
2. alter default max spots to 100 and the no of WWV to 5
17Dec01=======================================================================
1. added new satellite stuff from Steve K9AN. Fixed upper/lower problem
in convkeps.pl.
2. enhanced load/keps to accept a message no. This will create a new keps
file from a msg (hopefully containing 2 Line Nasa keps) and then load - all
in one step. Added load/keps to the help files
3. Updated spanish Messages
4. Improve wcy command from Stephan DK8LV's input
5. Added set/prompt (and unset/prompt) command so that Stephan can fool some
external programs into thinking it is talking to clx.
15Dec01=======================================================================
1. added superfluous spaces back into PC73 for the benefit of clx
14Dec01=======================================================================
1. make Spanish in set/lang & Messages 'es' instead of 'sp'
2. added prototype WCY and WWV commands (for qualified users only)
3. Added Commands_es.hlp contributed by Angel EA7WA
12Dec01=======================================================================
1. added Commands_de.hlp contributed (in record time) by Stephan DK8LV.
2. fixed help command so it uses it!
11Dec01=======================================================================
1. make PC17 generation more unconditional
08Dec01=======================================================================
1. added unset/hops command
02Dec01=======================================================================
1. Fix spurious 'new message for you' messages if things are deleted but 
unread.
2. stop remote passive nodes (those with version numbers of 0000) from
poluting the nodes table. Maybe this will make things slightly more stable.
3. Take off rspf checks on announces and spots and allow the dupe filters
to take the strain.
4. Move the dupe checking AFTER the input filtering for announces and spots.
5. Changed the checking of PC19/21 that it doesn't alter the wrong node
6. Alter the storage of messages so that illegal characters are stored as '.' 
in an attempt to stop such messages from hanging.
26Nov01=======================================================================
1. Make changes to the installation manual to show making the client before
actually trying to use it!  Thanks to oz1lqh.  Also add a line for SuSE
distros on useradd.
22Nov01=======================================================================
1. finally fix DELETE = ^H = Backspace in console.pl
21Nov01=======================================================================
1. altered the PC16/17 generation slightly to see whether this cures Roland's
problem.
19Nov01=======================================================================
1. added Ducie Island to prefixes
17Nov01=======================================================================
1. updated the Java Web Interface from Ian, m0azm to allow passwords.  If
a user with no password enters anything, including null, it is happily
accepted and ignored.
2. added the German language to the Messages file from Stephan, dk8lv
14Nov01=======================================================================
1. make the number of characters of the dx comment dependant on the type of
connection. This should mean that 'legacy' user programs can cope.
2. move the handling of unprintable characters out of IntMsg
07Nov01=======================================================================
1. fix is_pctext so that it actually catches corrupt spots and announces.
2. fix console.pl so that you can type in '0' again
3. Fix problem with reply disappearing up its own bottom.
4. Added Steve's latest sh/moon stuff
06Nov01=======================================================================
1. fix read so that sysop reading doesn't increment the read counter for 
private mail not addressed to them.
2. fix console.pl to show blank lines more reliably.
3. fix msgs so that 2 R: lines are only stored on initial entry (not just
after forwarding).
04Nov01=======================================================================
1. Allow the user to equal the node in RSPF checks (this allows spots and 
stuff with the origin and spotter to be the same (although it is STRONGLY 
recommended that they are NOT!!! [hint hint]).
2. make the send command rather more sensitive to what is allowed. Basically
it will only allow TO addresses that are bull addresses (if not private) or
vaild callsigns (if private). Bull addresses are the ones in 
/spider/msg/forward.pl with a 'T' flag on them. If there is no forward 
file it will only allow 'ALL' and 'DX' as valid Bull TO addresses. You may
use commas as callsign separators if you like.  
02Nov01=======================================================================
1. fixed some Aliasing problems, but this whole area will have to be addressed
more comprehensively.
2. Changed talk logging so that it hopefully is more consistant and maybe even
useful.
3. Altered the mechanism of the personal emailing so that it uses lower level
components and should be therefore available on M$ platforms. You will need
to install a version of libnet (perl -MCPAN -eshell, then install Net::SMTP).
I believe all 5.6.x perls have this built in (ie M$ should have this). If you
are on M$ or you want to use an MTA via SMTP in linux then you need to declare
the dns name of the MTA by: set/var $DXMsg::email_server = 'post.fred.net' 
(or whatever the MTA is called). You can also use local programs other than
sendmail by: set/var $DXMsg::email_prog = '/usr/bin/postfix ..' or whatever.
Finally you can alter the 'from' address using: set/var $DXMsg::email_from
= 'FBloggs@msn.com' (\@ if you use " and ") - bewarned that you may be 
prevented from using just any old address. You can place these commands in
/spider/scripts/startup for permanent use.
01Nov01=======================================================================
1. added information on registration, login scripts and passwords to the
26Oct01=======================================================================
1. If $main::reqreg = 1 then set/register will allow 'registered' users 
full access, if $main::reqreg = 2 then registered users will be 'read-only'
(ie the opposite). If $main::reqreg = 0 then registration and its effects
are disabled.
25Oct01=======================================================================
1. added unset/password command to allow sysops (only) to completely delete
and remove a user's password.
2. make 'read' increment the 'no of times read' for all messages.
3. give a read receipt for everybody that reads a message so marked.
4. enhance set/email so that if you set email address(es) with this command
it will send any messages to your callsign as they come in. unset/email
will disable forwarding. 
24Oct01=======================================================================
1. added (un)set/register, show/registered commands which when a 'set/var
$main::reqreg = 1' is done in the startup script will require users to 
be 'registered' in order for them to have 'write' access to the node. Non-
registered users will only be allowed to TALK or SEND PRIVATE to the cluster
sysop callsign.
2. Added password interrogation to the ExtMsg connections. If a user comes
in via telnet and this is being done with the internal listener and a pass-
word has been set for that user - he will be asked for it. You can force 
a password interrogation (for ALL users) with a 'set/var $main::passwdreq = 1'
in the node's startup script. It is anticipated that if you are using
registration you will also issue passwords to those registered users.
3. set/password has been changed so that users already with passwords can 
change them.   
4. A non-registered user will get the /spider/data/motd_nor file instead of
the motd on login.
5. made the BadWord regexes slightly less aggressive WARNING this may let
some constructions thru, but hopefully will also allow more legitimate 
foreign (mainly) things thru as well. 
19Oct01=======================================================================
1. Allow DELETE (0x7f) for backspace in console.pl
2. redo prefix table using latest cty.dat
14Oct01=======================================================================
1. Add the shortform SH/ST like display to sh/user <call> to make it more
AK1A compatible (G0RDI+G4PDQ pace).
12Oct01=======================================================================
1. make del nnn delete messages again (fix system Aliases file)
2. substr the subject so that the dup works for stuff coming back via AK1A
09Oct01=======================================================================
1. change Aliases to allow shutdown as a command again. If you have changed
/spider/cmd/Aliases and you update from CVS you may find it better to remove
this file and then do another 'cvs update'. Otherwise you may get conflicts
and the Aliase file will not load properly. The cvs update will recreate 
the (now) missing file.
2. Remove the 'please don't use XXXX on here' messages to prevent people
from exploring the 'bad words space'. Three bad words will still disconnect
without warning. 
3. Sending dx spots/announces with bad words will succeed - but only back to
the sender. These two mods are designed to annoy the perpitrators of the
sort of filth as much as possible whilst not inconveniencing 'normal' users.
4. Add expunge feature to kill. Deleting messages now marks a msg for 
deletion two days hence. To have the old behaviour, do a 'kill exp' or use
the standard alias "expunge". This will cause the message to be deleted at
the next queue message cycle.
5. Put in prototype echo handling for direct connections using ExtMsg and
Listeners.pm.
6. fix msgs to g1tlh-2 (as opposed to g1tlh)
04Oct01=======================================================================
1. allow a residence time of (default) 2 days before actually deleting a msg.
2. reduce the number R: lines on a bull from a bbs to 2 (the origin and the
last port of call).
3. ignore deleted messages for queuing purposes
4. store deleted status across restarts!
5. make callsign checking more rigorous
6. dup check PC49 (kill full)
7. improved the regex matching of badwords (more efficient, better coverage)
8. added default badword and badw_regex tables (as .issue files) which will
activate unless there is one there already. It will NOT overwrite an existing
file - so if you change it your changes will remain intact.
03Oct01=======================================================================
1. don't allow @WWW to become a 'TO' field...
2. handle @gb7tlh.#35.eu type addresses as well
02Oct01=======================================================================
1. fixed the 'ever lengthening msg' syndrome and probably made the whole
thing more reliable at the same time.
2. do some restructuring of the msg system and upissue the version no.
3. fix @xxxx syntax for bbs input
01Oct01=======================================================================
1. made login info not the default
2. change the looping protoection for PC16/17/19/21 and also be more rigorous
in who we accept which PC16/17/21's from.
3. fix MAJOR disconnect bug introduced accidentally in the NP work.
4. Try each badword with an S on the end as well and also check for 'f.u   c'
type things as well (this only works for a few wellknown english ones).
5. Go back to the old way of caching commands (but without the silly warnings
because I know better what I am doing now). This allows symbolic debugging
of commands again without coredumps. Hurrah!
6. Add badword handling for messages. Users will get rude messages back if
they try to send naughty words in msgs. Incoming messages with badwords will
be dropped on receipt and their contents logged.
7. and if you swear 3 or more times you are unceremoniously logged out.
30Sep01=======================================================================
1. made some small bug fixes in rspf checking and also messages. 
23Sep01=======================================================================
1. I have incorporated Steve's (K9AN) lastest sh/sun and sh/moon stuff which
copes much better with some of the end effects that occur in these calc-
ulations. You can now also see up to a year into the past or future. The 
results compare favourably with the US Naval Obs (unlike certain other
software's output which "I would not want to use their results to aim my 
moon rocket..."). It also fixes some ambiguity about which day the results
are actually for.
21Sep01=======================================================================
1. fix set/lockout so that it is possible to lock out all SSIDs except those
specifically unlocked and so that you don't need to lock the non-SSID call in
order to lock an SSID call. So set/lock g1tlh will lock out all instances of
g1tlh, g1tlh-1, g1tlh-15 etc except (for instance) unset/lock g1tlh-9.
2. show/lock allows partial callsign matching so sh/lock gb7 will only show
GB7* calls that are locked.
3. Had a grand shift around for the start of NP.
19Sep01=======================================================================
1. put in some rudimentory rsfp checking for various things
2. tried to do some fixes on console.pl - YOU WILL REQUIRE Curses 1.06 from
CPAN (perl -MCPAN -eshell, then at cpan> install Curses). 
17Sep01=======================================================================
1. Fixed help and apropos commands so that they default to english if
the language is not english and help in the 'not english' language isn't
available.
2. added some help text for sh/newc.
15Sep01=======================================================================
1. released 1.48
2. found 1st bug, fixed unset/logininfo reseting itself after logout 
14Sep01=======================================================================
1. added the start of script files on login/startup. You can now add 
commands (for example to set variables) to a file called 
/spider/scripts/startup. You can also put in scripts for a callsign which
will be executed when that callsign logs on. A sample script is in the
directory (you did remember to do cvs update -d?). User settable versions
of this will happen when the general mechanism for doing that is available.
2. Added set/unset/anntalk commands. If you unset/anntalk then you will
no longer see many of the of talk like announces. Unfortunately you may
miss the odd useful one as well (but since everything is repeated many times
you probably won't :-)
3. centralise the invalid callsign check so that g1tlh1 and similar calls
will not be allowed to login anymore.
4. Fiddle with the lockout mechanism so that set/login g1tlh also locks out
g1tlh-1 -> g1tlh-15 UNLESS one of these is specifically unlocked.
5. Make sh/log only show stuff that sh/ann, sh/talk, sh/rcmd doesn't.
6. Make the scripts look for user and node_default files if there isn't a 
more specific one.
7. add the blank command which prints nn blank lines (default 1), this cmd
can also print lines of characters: see help for examples.
13Sep01=======================================================================
1. did some work on making talk more intelligent and fixed a>b problem.
2. fixed a nasty problem on input when being hit with full buffers of 
data (eg at init time with large lists of node/users on fast links).
3. fixed realtime input filter changing.
4. added announce->talk conversion for routable calls when announces of the
form 'to g1tlh hello', 't g1tlh hello'  or 'g1tlh hello' appear. 
This also suppresses similar announces for users whose callsign is not the 
one in the announce.
5. Change the badwords interface to be the same as baddx, badspotter et al.
added set/badword, unset/badword and show/badword. This routine will auto
convert (and delete afterwards) the old badwords file. 
6. fix intermittant bullitin mail forwarding?
11Sep01=======================================================================
1. added IP address logging of connections
10Sep01=======================================================================
1. clear/* node_default and user_default now work.
2. in acc or rej/* you can now use (comma separated) prefixes as well as lists
of numbers for things like *_dxcc, *_itu and *_cq (eg: by_dxcc ve,w); just
remember that countries like ve and w have lots of zones and itus!
3. Added all the clear/* commands to help and added some comments about 2.
4. All filters (including *_default ones) are now reinstalled on channels in
realtime, so changing a filter does NOT require a disconnect and reconnect
cycle anymore. 
09Sep01=======================================================================
1. Add show/dxstats command
2. Add show/hfstats command
3. Add show/vhfstats command
4. Add show/hftable command
5. Add show/vhftable command (BE WARNED, the first time you run one of these
commands it will take some considerable time to complete, thereafter it will
be a lot faster).
08Sep01=======================================================================
1. Update the sgml docs on filtering a bit.
06Sep01=======================================================================
1. prevent nodes appearing as users from incoming PC16s
2. Change ping averaging to be like TCP and become a smoothed RTT.
3. Make all the Prompts in stat/* like output appear in alphebetical order
4. Fix problem with 17m spots not appearing in sh/dx
5. pump up eph dups everytime they re-occur and increase life to 180 secs
04Sep01=======================================================================
1. add delete/user command
03Sep01=======================================================================
1. make spot dups look back 5 mins.
2. strip the top off each character in any text field of a Spot for duping.
3. Try to make the routing tables more accurate for users that login to
more than one node.
4. Make PC50s come out in one heap on all channels every 14 mins, instead of
on the 14th minute in the connection time for each channel. This should 
reduce (slightly) the dups that are dumped.
5. Speed up input queue processing (a lot).
6. make set/isolate and acc/route mutually exclusive (and issue appropriate
error messages) and fix set/iso on PC18 input.
7. Improve stat/route_node and stat/route_user for diagnostics.
8. strip top bit of comments in ann/spots.
9. fix the announce filtering problem.
10. Fix the double announcement of node disconnections?
01Sep01=======================================================================
1. Change build number calc (hopefully for the last time)
27Aug01=======================================================================
1. make rej/wwv and rej/wcy work
26Aug01=======================================================================
1. make all newly learned nodes locked out by default.
2. add lock_nodes.pl which locks out all the nodes in the user file whose
privilege is 1 or less and which isn't mentioned as an argument to the 
command on the command line.
3. make set/node, set/spider and their friends unlock a node as well as make
them one. 
4. Make sh/log et al more efficient / less memory hungry (and the display
the correct way round!)
24Aug01=======================================================================
1. Allow badmsg to reject on interface callsign ('I')
20Aug01=======================================================================
1. protect against PC41s with field[3] == field[2]
2. Redo Julian stuff as proper objects
3. Make the various Log display come out forwards instead of backwards
4. Add the dbgclean routine to system cron to clear out all debug files 
more then 10 days old.
19Aug01=======================================================================
1. Fix rcmds
2. make isolation when there are no filters present work again?
3. dup check PC16/17/19/21 !
17Aug01=======================================================================
1. Sort out PC41 handling to include type 5 records for QRA locators and also
remove all filtering (but retain ephemeral dup checking).
2. Improve format checking in latlong and qra locators.
3. Sort sh/st so that sh/st by itself displays only the local call not the
whole lot (all 17000+ users records in my case). SH/ST ALL does this.
16Aug01=======================================================================
1. send a forward/opernam for a logged in user once a month (when they next
login).
2. rearrange rcmd stuff to be more maintainable and also be certain that 
they are translated in both directions correctly for clx and ak1a style.
3. Allow PC41s to be propagated and hope that the ephemeral dup filters 
do their job!
15Aug01=======================================================================
1. fix problem with talks not coming out anymore
13Aug01=======================================================================
1. fixed problem of dxspots not being echoed back to spotter (announces too)
02Aug01=======================================================================
1. correct manual and help references on accept/route and reject/route. Thanks
to ea1dav for pointing out the errors
2. make sure that the actual line is printed in grepdbg & watchdbg esp. with
ALL the '^' and leading space characters as they really are
30Jul01=======================================================================
1. changes to manuals to add links etc. (g0vgs)
23Jul01=======================================================================
1. made ann,dx spots,wwv,wcy,wx more 'object oriented'.
2. allow for 'enhanced clients' and tell them what sort of thing is being 
sent.
3. Allow debug info to be sent via interface to an enhanced client.
21Jul01=======================================================================
1. started a gtkconsole program. It appears to sort of work. Requires Gtk-
Perl-0.7007.
2. start doing some spot statistical stuff. 
19Jul01=======================================================================
1. changes to Admin Manual to reflect route filtering.  Some alterations to
the help files (g0vgs)
09Jul01=======================================================================
1. fix cron so that it allows stuff to be executed on the hour (ie min=0)
06Jul01=======================================================================
1. fix talk and routing problems to mycall
2. add unset/privilege command to relinquish any sysop privileges you might 
have for the current session.

contains at least a blank
16Jun01=======================================================================
1. fix talk
2. fix stat/msg 
14Jun01=======================================================================
1. changed debug api to (potentially) use less cpu time
2. changed the spider.cgi in Arnold's borrowed java client to Ian's perl 
script
3. Added input route filtering
4. put back the set/isolate logic into routing which is now overridable with
filters whcih means a default filter is no longer generated. If you want the
OLD behaviour, do rm /spider/filter/route/*.pl*, restart and try again. 
5. Add http_proxy to Internet.pm and allow sh/qrz to use an HTTP Proxy
13Jun01=======================================================================
1. fix init cnd rinit cmds
2. add missing clear/route cmd
10Jun01=======================================================================

(for sysops only)
3. add ephemera deduping for all those PC41,24,50 etc etc broadcasts 
4. Fix a problem with the connect text being sent on outgoing connections
(this confuses db0fhf amongst other things)
5. catch deep recursion bugs before you run out of memory.
6. Make sure that PC16|17|19|21 update as well as add and delete
7. local announces by the sysop will always be displayed
08Jun01=======================================================================
1. first cut with new routing code. Created NEW_ROUTE branch
2. added acc/route and rej/route commands
3. added stat/route_node and stat/route_user commands to look at the routing
table entities
07Jun01=======================================================================
1. move userconfig.pl and nodeconfig.pl to stat/
2. fix problem with locally connected users not being removed from the 
routing tables
3. Fix the build calc to take into account subdirectories
06Jun01=======================================================================
1. add stat/route_node and stat/route_user commands
2. add sh/userconfig command (to show backward links to nodes)
3. add sh/nodeconfig command
05Jun01=======================================================================
1. add set/bbs command
2. more work on Routing code.
3. status/msg on its own will print the status of the msg system.
4. add sh/newconfig command
03Jun01=======================================================================
1. Fix the problem with ExtMsg and unresolvable IP addresses, hopefully
properly this time.
15May01=======================================================================
1. set/lockout now prevents any outgoing connection taking place.
2. Started the new routing stuff which will run in parallel for a while.
3. changed the msg timeout arrangements so that it might not get stuck so
easily.
4. add $DXMsg::bulltopriv global to make msgs to known callsigns private 
14May01=======================================================================
1. fix problem with re-reading in db definitions for remote databases.
2. try to prevent situations where two can (semi) successfully login, probably
under load, and get a 'tried to connect whilst already connected' abort.
3. change the max number of days to search for spots to 100
11May01=======================================================================
1. allow stat/msg on priv 1
07May01=======================================================================
1. set/page 0 switches off paging
03May01=======================================================================
1. It appears that for ages now, not enough PC19 and PC16s are being sent
if you have more than one of them. Sigh..
02May01=======================================================================
1. put an upper limit on the number of concurrent errors allowed in command
mode (20). This should disconnect runaway spot suckers....
28Apr01=======================================================================
1. fix an occasional problem with 'sorry connected to' messages
23Apr01=======================================================================
1. fix very long standing bug in storing and transmitting spots. The decimal
point was left off :-(
22Apr01=======================================================================
1. Sysops can now have full privileges if there is a ExtMsg listener on 
localhost (or everything) and they telnet to localhost and login with their
callsign. This means that they don't need a client anymore (for local access)
2. added input spot filtering. 
3. Added run_cmd to DXCron which allows you to run any command on the system
from the crontab. (Dunno why I didn't do this before). 
18Apr01=======================================================================
1. added Ian M0AZM's Java Client (SpiderConsole)
17Apr01=======================================================================
1. made a slight speedup on write in Msg.pm (about doubled it)
16Apr01=======================================================================
1. make the correct error messages come out on reject/accept when people
leave out keywords like 'on'.
2. Fairly major changes to the documentation tree.  Split the admin manual
into 2 sections, Installation and Admin and merge the Windows stuff.
15Apr01=======================================================================
1. made some mods to the sgml documentation for 1.47
2. added show/connect command
11Apr01=======================================================================
1. fixed more of the "xxx disappeared from yyy" messages
2. altered the build no logic so that it always checksums the same files
regardless of whatever else you might have in the directory.
3. made shortcut at shutdown so that you don't get a storm of PC21s on busy
nodes as each connection goes down. Just send a pc39 to each interface and
nothing else.
4. changed action of SIG{INT} and SIG{TERM} so that they now work on MSWin32
10Apr01=======================================================================
1. altered PC21 logic somewhat to eliminate dup PC21s
2. disconnect should remove dangling local users in the routing table.
3. fixed nasty recursive timer bug

08Apr01=======================================================================
1. added a quick installation guide to the admin manual and removed references
to client.pl (g0vgs)
01Apr01=======================================================================

crontabs rather than AGWMsg::init();
2. try to thread winclient.pl for MSWin32.
31Mar01=======================================================================
1. added agwrestart command
2. add Iains Windoze installation manual (g0vgs)

2. fix the non-blocking problems of connects (and other things in general).
non-blocking only works for unix implementations at the moment.
3. add rinit command (sends a PC20)
4. improve debuging so that stuff is always escaped and a new 'raw' debug 
mode that shows everything sent and received in glorious hex and characters
29Mar01=======================================================================
1. add better tracking of AGW circuits (possibly)
2. add set and unset/agwmonitor (ing) [for all the notice it seems to take]
28Mar01=======================================================================
1. AGW engine stuff now accepts incoming calls and at least attempts to do
outgoing ones. YMMV.
2. fixed 'always' telnet on a client line in a connect script
27Mar01=======================================================================
1. add first cut at an AGW Engine. Copy /spider/perl/AGWConnect.pm to 
/spider/local and edit it appropriately. You shouldn't need a login and passwd
if you are using the default setup. It may allow incoming connects (and then
again it may not - I don't have a reliable infrostructure to test with at the
moment). The AGW Engine is a M$ thingy, but that don't preclude you connecting
to it from a unix box. 
22Mar01=======================================================================
1. edit the helpfile for set/debug and add help for show/debug
2. Allow ^Z again on messages
3. Added back onboard support for ax25 OUTBOUND connections. You will need
exactly the same facilities as before (ie netrom_call, ax25_call suid root 
etc) but it is called direct from the cluster.pl - client.pl is DEAD!
19Mar01=======================================================================
1. Add 'not allowed' messages into sh/filter with callsign and reduce priv
2. decode %xx characters in winclient.pl
necessary to 1.
18Mar01=======================================================================

file is present.
3. changed policy of $censorpc in DXProt.pm so that badwords are looked for
in all text announces etc.
4. Unpad (remove excess spaces from) spotted callsigns in PC11. 
5. test for opertaing system in various places and do different if M$
27Feb01=======================================================================
1. allow partial node callsigns on sh/c (eg sh/c gb7)
2. Changed Msg.pm to allow a more generalised interface with more than one
listener.
3. Added IntMsg.pm to implement the internal connection management that is
currently scattered about the cluster code.
25Feb01=======================================================================
1. Fixed watchdbg so that simple arguments work again
22Feb01=======================================================================
1. Added platform name to sh/version
2. changed client.pl so that it send \r\n instead of \n on telnet connects
3. added lineend '\r\n' command to connect scripts so you can override 
defaults
03Feb01=======================================================================

13Jan01=======================================================================
1. Documentation alterations to match new commands etc (g0vgs)
08Jan01=======================================================================
1. Changed the way that badnodes, baddx etc work. There is a new general way
implemented (dunno why I didn't do this before - hey ho...) as a consequence
there are set/unset/show baddx (for bad dx callsigns) badnode (for dx from
bad nodes) badspotter (for bad spotters of dx eg VE2STN). Expect more of 
this sort of thing...
2. Added one to the copyright dates...
06Jan01=======================================================================
1. Fix set/obscount so it actually works.
2. Allow different number formats for set/pingint eg: 5m for 5 minutes and

03Jan01=======================================================================
1. Added a txt directory for txt versions of manuals (g0vgs)
2. Various documentation changes
02Jan01=======================================================================
1. added a help file for forward/latlong and updated the admin manual to
match. (g0vgs)

where digits are the 'wrong' way round.
2. made default max days to search for spots 3 months.
3. added hex decodes for those pesky 'national' characters that aren't really
in grepdbg and watchdbg.
4. decide that we are using Latin-1 and therefore characters 0x80-0x9f are
not allowed.
5. fix the announces so that they are all UPPER CASE for poor old DXTelnet.
03Dec00=======================================================================
1. change grepdbg and watchdbg so that you can see a number of lines before
the condx that you are looking for so:-
  grepdbg 3 LOOP
  watchdbg 3 LOOP 
will show both the LOOP line and the preceeding 2 lines.
2. add PCPROT to all error condx lines in DXProt.pm so that you can watch
for them more easily.

07Nov00=======================================================================
1. removed sh/call because the owner isn't happy about us using it. 
2. change sh/qrz to the new interface. MUCH QUICKER! you will need a user id
and password from qrz.com to use it and you will have to copy the 
/spider/perl/Internet.pm to /spider/local and alter it accordingly. Do 
remember to set $allow=1 as well! The new interface comes courtesy of Fred
LLoyd, the proprietor of http://www.qrz.com
06Nov00=======================================================================

03Nov00=======================================================================
1. allow - in filter strings
2. store only the filter expression NOTE BENE: you will need to clear all 
your existing filters and re-enter them!!!!!!
3. Added announce filtering
4. Fixed problem with announce filtering on output to the node
02Nov00=======================================================================
1. updated filtering logic. You will need to RECREATE your filters (clear/spot
all, then start again) for testing.
2. allow PC73 for DXNet
3. added some help text for filtering and filtering spots in particular.
01Nov00=======================================================================
1. put PC11 field 2 check back to m for pc text.
2. improve 'simple' callsign checking
3. Added the first cut of the new user/sysop filtering code. This cut works 
for spots and the syntax is:-

accept/spots [<call>] [input] [<filterno>] things ..
reject/spots [<call>] [input] [<filterno>] things ..

where things are: 
  freq 0/30000 | hf | hf/cw | 6m,4m,2m
  call G,PA,HB9
  info iota
  by G,PA,HB9
  call_dxcc 61,62
  call_itu 31
  call_zone 14,15,16
  by_dxcc 61,62
  by_itu 31
  by_zone 14,15,16
  origin GB7,MB7
  channel GB7DJK,GB7BAA
      
You can simply string these together on one line one after the other and 
there is an implied 'and', you can also string together with 'or' 'not' (or
'!') and '(' and ')' - in otherwords an arbitrary expression.
              
You can see what you have done with:

show/filter [<call>]

You can clear your work with:

clear/spots [<call>] [input] [<filterno>|all]

Have fun and someone please write the documentation.
4. Added show/msg_status.pl sysop command (shows some info on what is busy in 
the message system)

29Oct00=======================================================================
1. put in echo cancelling measures into the clients. This doesn't mean you
shouldn't take steps to prevent echoing on node links, but it may help where
(whatever you do) it still bloody echos! This is experimental.
2. store dxchan and mynode as callsigns (and not references) in the routing 
tables and do some checking in accessors to see if we can capture some errors.
3. tart up the stat/chan etc display to give more useful debugging info 
28Oct00=======================================================================
1. updated show/sun and show/moon from stuff sent by Steve Franke K9AN
2. added show/call which queries jeifer.pineknot.com for any call in the 
world (as opposed to UALR which only does US calls). Inspired by a bit of 
perl sent to me by Steve Franke (again!) and also Angel EA7WA who gave me the
pineknot ip address.
3. fixed clients so that they accept -0 as a valid SSID and then strip it off
as though they had come in without (why has this taken so long to appear? How
long have we been running this code ??????). 
27Oct00=======================================================================
1. alter the code in clean_old of DXMsg system to see if we get some different
behaviour with random crashing

on announce filters - see the /spider/filter/ann/*.issue files for more info.
4. you can now specify a 'user_default.pl', 'node_default.pl' and 
'in_node_default.pl' in each of the filter directories

intermediate client->server protocol to '.'.
04Sep00=======================================================================
1. made PC10,11,12 badword checking dependant on a flag variable ($censorpc)
default = 0 (off).
02Sep00=======================================================================
1. fix a long standing talk bug to do with routing to specific nodes (t xxx >
yyy .....)
2. Add badwords checking in various places. You put a list of words into
/spider/data/badwords one or several per line. Lines starting with # are
ignored. PC10, PC11, PC12 with words contained in this file will not be
sent on. Also ann, talk and dx commands have badword checking added. Words
are NOT case sensitive, but you will need to put all the endings in (eg 
...k, ...ker, ...king).
3. Added new version of admin manual from G0VGS.
01Sep00=======================================================================
1. allow blank on field 4 of PC10 (even though it's "illegal").
28Aug00=======================================================================
1. changes DXChannel::get_all_ak1a to get_all_nodes.
2. ignore PC21s coming in on the interface with that callsign (ie nodes 
trying to disconnect themselves).

(and transparently for spider nodes).
26Aug00=======================================================================
1. make blank origins on messages the node call.
2. added new version of FAQ from Ian G0VGS

1. Added system Alias for set/nodxgrid => unset/dxgrid
2. Add full individual checking for all PC protocol fields in all messages

and longitude set on them to one or more locally connected nodes - with a hop
count of 1.

on DX announcements
10. Removed export_user.pl (no longer needed)
11. made import_users.pl accept a non related input filename and always
update the current user file.
12. added an 'auto rcmd <node> for/oper <call>' for people I can see on the
cluster that issue spots and for whom I have no qra info (no more than once
a month). This isn't the default - set $send_opernam in
/spider/local/DXProtVars.pm (copied from /spider/perl). Good for gateways.
13. Despace spot texts properly again for deduping purposes.
14. Corrected Pc84/85 handling a bit.

Arnold's Sparcs don't then crash.
19Jun00=======================================================================
1. move ann_dup, spot_dup etc to dup_ann, dup_spots etc
2. made mode 3 the default line ending convention for all out going connects
via telnet in client.pl

09Jun00=======================================================================
1. change some print commands in DXMsg to dbg('err'...
2. overloaded confess, croak et al into DXDebug and removed Carp from 
everywhere and checked that the necessary debugging really does go into
the debug files now.
3. changed print statements in cluster.pl to dbg('err',... so they go into
the debug files as well.
4. Altered the logic around duplicate spots, reduced the length of comment
checked to 20 characters (this should solve some problems including those
people sucking ar-cluster spots with prefixes in the extreme rh end). 
08Jun00=======================================================================
1. fixed problem with binary characters from cluster->client
2. added set/echo and unset/echo commands
3. echo login characters on login: prompt for C client
4. Send \r\n on telnet connections for C Client
5. Make echoing the default option (for M$ telnet clients :-()
11May00=======================================================================
1. fixed looping in Msg.pm (at last)
10May00=======================================================================
1. wrote a cross between 'tail -f' and grepdbg so that you can watch the
debug files for particular strings and only have them print out. 
05May00=======================================================================
1. rewrote parts of Msg.pm and client.c so that the messages no longer use
a length word at the front of each one. They are simply strings of characters
separated by a \n. No binary characters are allowed (they are encoded as %nn)
a la HTTP. This hopefully cures Arnold's problem and also make it more
secure anyway. It also paves the way for the ax25/ip multicast client.
30Apr00=======================================================================
1. put some extra checks and balances in to message send routine in Msg.pm to
see if I can prevent the error seen by Arnold (which I think is only likely to
appear in heavily loaded sites).
25Apr00=======================================================================
1. Changed reply so that you can reply to more than one address privately
31Mar00=======================================================================
1. fixed nnn-mmm in kill (erase/delete) msgs so that mmm is also deleted and
not just nnn -> mmm-1.
2. Added an autosplit to message importing so that messages are split
automagically into bits if the filename used in the import directory starts
with "split". This will add a [1/5] type string on the the end of the subject. 
3. dedupe more aggressively on the text of Spots so that only the 1st 27 chars
of text are considered (as opposed to the whole lot).
30Mar00=======================================================================
1. altered client.pl connect code so that it doesn't falsely recognise 
/spider/src/client as a 'client' instruction.
28Mar00=======================================================================
1. Added buffering to client 
2. Fixed LOGIN so that you can login with an arbitrary callsign
27Mar00=======================================================================
1. updated wpxloc.raw and rsgb.cty for 4W and TX0.
2. display 'start time' rather than 'last start time in' in who.
3. Allow local users to see their own sh/talk or sh/log stuff.
4. A more robust version of the C client.
5. Added a message exporting command 'export'.
6. allow swopping on all messages, including imported and manually sent ones
7. S A < B @ C $BID now works from the command line and thus bbses ought to
be able to send messages into the cluster. Bids are (currently) ignored.
26Mar00=======================================================================
1. first cut of C client
18Mar00=======================================================================
1. fixed convkeps.pl so that it accepts more formats for floating point.
08Mar00=======================================================================
1. tidied up Sun.pm and sh/sat
2. fixed sh/qra so that the correct lat/long is displayed if only one locator
is given.
10Jan00=======================================================================
1. added Steve Franke's new Sun.pm and show/satellite command
08Jan00=======================================================================
1. really removed the restriction on 0 length messages.
2. added a periodic msg file import system a la FBB. Stick one or more files
into /spider/msg/import with a suitable SEND line, subject and the text and 
it will import it. The importer will accept some BBS syntax (eg < GB7TLH) to
allow you to customise the 'from' callsign.
03Jan00=======================================================================
1. changed the copyright statement in sh/version!
2. added sh/date with special "be compatible with ak1a" syntax for the output
of sh/date with no arguments, otherwise the same as sh/time. A special favour
to G4PDQ...
3. and another one, added show/node especially for G4PDQ.
01Jan00=======================================================================
1. Fixed Julian routines to get rid of the millenium bug! (do as I say, not
as I do!).
2. updated gdx.pl so that external programs can do a sh/dx just as a normal
user can. On reflection this could be used as a model for all sorts of 
"external" interface routines.
3. renamed gdx.pl as showdx.
11Dec99=======================================================================
1. added missing pc48 so that it calls the DXDb::process routine 
10Dec99=======================================================================
1. allow msgs to marked as read or unread
02Dec99=======================================================================
1. DX command doesn't recognise '6M' as '6m' in SH/DX ON 6M.
2. set/node now sets the homenode as the callsign.
3. changed the label for the 18Mhz band from '18m' to '17m' in the bands 
table. 
01Dec99=======================================================================
1. started the callbot which lives at n2tly.dxcluster.net 9000.
2. added www.qrz.com
3. added www.buck.com
4. added k4ute at no4j.com
28Nov99=======================================================================
1. fixed all the stupid errors introduced in 1.36 confusing DXUser->get with
DXCluster->get_exact.
24Nov99=======================================================================
1. extended badmsg.pl stuff so that it works like the forward file and allows
one to reject on to, from, origin and subject fields.
2. added a swop.pl again in a forward.pl like format that allows simple swop
for a field or test on a field and set another.
3. Fixed the problem that read private mail follows you around as well as
unread private mail does.
4. Change the logic of connections so that the node will accept callsigns with
SSIDs to -8 as different entities from each other. SSIDs > 8 are subtracted 
from 15 and are assumed to be coming in via netrom diddled connections. This
affects lots of the commands as well. I may not have got them all.
5. Hangup clients on HUP signals. I originally ignored them, for reasons that
are now lost in the mists of time. HUP signals now cause clients to die 
(cleanly) and disconnect everything correctly.
6. Added show/time command
21Nov99=======================================================================
1. lose extraneous rubbish after the callsign as sent by BBSes.
2. Change end label on sh/moon to RGain dB rather than Loss dB.
3. Remove spurious call to DXCluster->get_exact in pc50.
4. Allow rcmd to locally connected nodes that are not (for some reason) in the
nodes table.
5. Try and send a PC39 in more cases to a cluster that I want to disconnect
from in the hope that it notices and disconnects its end.
20Nov99=======================================================================
1. Added set/unset logininfo which will tell anybody that has this set when
someone has either logged in or out of this node.
2. Added set/pinginterval command which alters the length of time between
pings sent to nodes, the value is minutes < 120 and seconds above that, 0
means disable pinging (not recommended).
3. If someone does a sysop whilst connected via ax25, don't show privilege
level or passwd in stat/user.
4. Fixed the problem with the dx command where if the callsign ended in a ?
then the call and the freq would be replicated in the remarks.
5. Set/unset ann, dx, talk, beep, wx, wwv all are now permanent (ie stored in
the user file)
19Nov99=======================================================================
1. Added new version of sh/sun and also sh/moon from Steve K9AN
2. Added rtt to who.
3. added Aliase for show/tnc_sta to who.
4. added Alias for show/uptime to sh/cl 
18Nov99=======================================================================
1. Added ping obs counter together with Time::HiRes timers. This will dis-
connect nodes that fail to respond to 3 ping requests (on the 4th attempt). 
The default time is a ping every 3 mins, therefore a link will be struck out
after 12 minutes of nil response.
2. Maintain a table of outstanding connects to other nodes and prevent over-
laps (special favour to G0RDI).
17Nov99=======================================================================
1. Started using Data::Dumper for things again
2. 'Fixed' DXUser file corruption?
3. Allow multiline (ie lines with \n in them) output in $DXChannel::send 
4. Added Andrew K9CW's updated wpxloc.raw, regenerated prefix_data.pl
5. Put in callsign matching and stuff into sh/sun.
14Nov99=======================================================================
1. added BBS.pm to start BBS input of mail
2. fixed eval in DXUser to log errors rather than banging out
12Nov99=======================================================================
1. added sh/sun command kindly supplied by Steve K9AN.
2. allow ^Z on its own on a line to terminate a message
08Nov99=======================================================================
1. added spoofing (mk1 version) for sysops, useful for those little jobs like
reseting a user's qra locator and such like "spoof g7brn set/qra jo02lq".
2. fixed set/location so it stores the qra locator in the qra locator slot, 
NOT the lat/long (who wrote this stuff...?).
07Nov99=======================================================================
1. reduced the amount of stuff compared against for dup announces.
2. Check the regex for DK0WCY announces produces results before storing it as
a WWV.
3. Added some logging for set/priv (un)set/lockout.
4. Added test long path calc to sh/muf
5. Only wonder down the msg queue every minute
6. Put in the initial DB code (at last), you can create and remove local and
standard remote dbs, you can import AK1A style .FUL ascii databases, you can
enquire on a local or remote database.
7. A return ping to a node will clear down all outstanding pings to
that node (which might cause some confusion if more then one ping is
outstanding for a node, but then - shit happens).
04Nov99=======================================================================
1. Removed ~ from the end of the PC18.
2. Removed a hangover from duff character checking in cluster.pl
3. Stop PC frames that are to be routed, being routed back to themselves.
03Nov99=======================================================================
1. Simplified command caching so it uses anonymous subroutines, you should
also get error messages back on the console now when developing.
2. Allow locally connected AK1A clusters that for some obscure reason don't
issue PC19s to still appear as connected and allow them to acquire users.
31Oct99=======================================================================
1. updated Minimuf.pm and show/muf.pl to the fixed versions sent to me by
Steve Franke K9AN. 
2. Made set/badnodes work, added show/badnodes. This is an interim fix until
input spot filtering works.
24Oct99=======================================================================
1. fixed announces so that nodes only get one of them (not two).
2. Altered the select timeouts to prevent apparent excessive CPU usage on
multiprocessor machines (or at least that is what seems to be the trouble
here). 
22Oct99=======================================================================
1. allow filter CALLSIGNS to be in upper or lower case.
2. create the concept of input and output filters, input filters are of the 
form "in_$call.pl" eg: "in_g1tlh.pl" (or "in_G1TLH.pl"), output filters are 
"g1tlh.pl" (or "G1TLH.pl").
3. all users can now filter on spots, ann and wwv (assuming the sysop has set
the filters up - still no user creatable filters. Nodes can filter on both
input for announces and output for all of these. I would recommend setting 
up a few filters that are likely to be wanted and then symlinking callsigns
to them as you get requests.
4. added callsign and length of history/position of screen stats to console.
If you want to change the colour of the callsign you will need to copy the
Console.pm to your /spider/local directory and change the $mycallcolor equate.
21Oct99=======================================================================
1. fixed reply so that reply b or reply nop generate a bulletin with the 
correct address.
2. implemented sh/muf command.
3. reduced privilege of catchup and uncatchup to 5. This so that, suitably
privileged, nodes that occasionally link can rcmd a "catchup <nodecall> all"
to the node they are connecting to and thus prevent a large tranche of, 
potentially duplicate, mail. This isn't an issue for DXSpider, but may be
an issue for any AK1A clusters you are connected to.
20Oct99=======================================================================
1. Translated all the subroutines of minimuf into perl as Minimuf.pm
2. Limited the length of an ANN that is saved for de-duping to $pc12_dup_lth
(def 72)
3. help command should now return stuff that you expect.
4. reduced necessary privilege to use 'MSG' command to 6.
5. Correct the count of spots and wwv for a merge.
6. Allow decodes of DK0WCY-3 WWV data beacon announces
7. rewrote send so that an SB doesn't send a buckshee bull to NOPRIVATE!
8. Changed default colouration on console so that all spots >= 50Mhz are red
9. Fixed init command so that PC21s are sent down non-initted channels
10. Allow forwarding of unknown private mail. This means that you can set up
forwarding of 'foreign' mail across to and by gateways using the same 
mechanism as bulletins (/spider/msg/forward.pl).
11. Allow line wrapping on the console (G0RDI, G0VGS et al).
18Oct99=======================================================================
1. changed help command so that it works correctly with multiple title lines.
2. added to address to the list of things a message checks to see whether it
is a duplicate (how on earth did it take _this_ long to find this one?).
3. Changes S CC so that the callsign it says it has sent to is the real one
(request from G8TIC)
21Sep99=======================================================================
1. allow zero messages to be stored (request from G4PDQ)
2. make DX more flexible and change spotter syntax to be consistant with
sh/dx (request from K9AN)
30Aug99=======================================================================
1. remove -@ as well as \d from SSIDs for spots
2. remove WEB and/or NET from the front or rear of callsigns in Prefix.pm
29Aug99=======================================================================
1. Added msg command to allow the changing of To, From, Subject and so on the
messages. This seems particularly important just now as a whole raft of G3's
seem to be putting out non private bulls to callsigns.
2. While I am at set messages to TO fields that appear to be users to private
if they have been sent as bulls.
3. Add DISTROs, if a callsign field appears in /spider/msg/distro in upper
use that as a list of callsigns to send further. Note this is potentially
recursive as callsigns in a distro can be distros.
25Aug99=======================================================================
1. check the date of a WWV much more carefully.
24Aug99=======================================================================
1. Prevented spots with lowercase callsigns being forwarded. This opens a
much bigger can of worms which I shall have to address later.
17Aug99=======================================================================
1. all protocol except PC29 containing %XX characters will be dumped.
2. Changed console.pl so that if you start typing it moves the top window
back to the bottom.
19Jul99=======================================================================
1. Added iota and qra clauses to sh/dx as well, these take optional arguments
and will look for the appropriate strings.
17Jul99=======================================================================
1. Started database integration.
2. added qsl clause to sh/dx that searches for qsl or via in the dx info
16Jul99=======================================================================
1. drop frames with 'illegal' characters in them (but pass frames with 
embedded %XX characters).
15Jul99=======================================================================
1. Changed grepdbg to accept a regexp. More useful (to me anyway).
2. Altered init command so that it doesn't send PC21s down the initted 
channel.
10Jul99=======================================================================
1. added an explicit disconnect from my side for already connected calls. This
appears to have fixed a problem where if two consoles connect at the same time
with the same (sysop?) callsign the cluster would stop.
2. added some debugging in the Message handler to allow more state to be seen.
3. Message handler now seems to work better for longer and doesn't spew out
PC42 aborts with quite such gay abandon.
05Jul99=======================================================================
1. added stat/msg and stat/cluster commands to allow me to poke about inside
the msg and cluster node tables.
04Jul99=======================================================================
1. removed silly 'new message has arrived' to connected nodes 
2. added a ! command to the console.pl program; works like the bash shell.
01Jul99=======================================================================
1. Altered priv to 5 for connect.pl to match disconnect for nodes
29Jun99=======================================================================
1. fixed merge command that I broke.
2. added some randomness in waittimes for aborted outgoing messages 
3. Message Queuing now only occurs every 5 minutes (configurable if anyone 
wants to write the command for doing it) and on receipt of a PC16. This is
a further attempt at sorting the crossing of messages!
4. a PC33 will cause another attempt at queuing. If you are on a roll, keep
going!
28Jun99=======================================================================
1. console.pl now works with history and editting.
2. added scrolling to stuff sent by the cluster.
3. added colours to things.
27Jun99=======================================================================
1. added WWV filtering
2. added timeouts to for forwarding Messages, also added a waiting time for
failed (stalled) outgoing messages.
3. Incoming messages will now have priority over outgoing messages to the
same node.
4. Added 'catchup' command which will 'catchup' messages to date for a node. 
This means that when you start forwarding to a node, it doesn't get all the
messages queued up that are probably old.
5. added 'uncatchup' which does the opposite of the above.
6. fixed kill full and PC49 handling so that it actually works.
7. Fixed local aliases so they add to the front of the standard ones. This
means you only need to add your specials or override the system ones you need
to.
21Jun99=======================================================================
1. changed regex for cluster->client msgs so that strings like |---| are no
longer ignored.
20Jun99=======================================================================
1. prevented a merge to myself (causes a loop)
18Jun99=======================================================================
1. fixed a problem with DXLogPrint repeating log entries.
2. altered the permissions on disconnnect so that priv 5 users can disconnect
clusters, but still require priv 8 to disconnect users.
3. made sure that an incoming PC18 clears out all the cluster info for
that channel before re-initialising.
4. add init command.
5. disconnect users before nodess on shutdown
15Jun99=======================================================================
1. added grepdbg program (so you can search your debug files and get times
and dates of incidents).
2. Moved DXVars.pm to DXVars.pm.issue to force new users to cp it to their
local directory.
3. added $allowzero to DXProt to allow thru PC19s with zero protocol versions.
14Jun99=======================================================================
1. changed IO::File in help and apropos to IO::File
2. added a check for isa('DXNode') for PC50s
08Jun99=======================================================================
1. Started work on the curses based operator console.
03Jun99=======================================================================
1. cluster seems to have a memory leak, put DESTROY functions in where 
appropriate.
2. try to make sure that PC21 commands are not issued inappropriately and
also reformat PC19 for onward broadcast so that nodes coming in on loops are
dropped from those broadcasts.
3. make sure PC16,17,19,21 doen't affect locally connected nodes.
4. Changed all instances of FileHandle to IO::File.
01Jun99=======================================================================
1. removed a output of an unwanted pc21 for isolated nodes
31May99=======================================================================
1. Added checking for PC16,17,19 and 21 to make sure that they come in from
the channels that they are supposed to.
2. Pass the RCMDing node's priv level to the command (rather than the 
connecting node's privilege level).
3. Pass thru merge requests for other nodes.
4. Removed a warning from client.pl
5. routed external DB commands and drop them (for now) locally
6. routed external mail commands (ie those addressed elsewhere)
7. routed external PC26/27 lines 
25May99=======================================================================
1. try to make the lastin value correct even for local users
2. got rid of the stupid bug that failed to print out the offline message
but put a "*main::STDOUTmain" for every line of that message instead.
3. Ported to 5.00503 (well actually just installed it and it just runs). 
4. Added who command
23May99=======================================================================
1. Got rid of some of the useless error messages on global destruction when
quiting a program.
2. Stuck -w back on client.pl
23May99=======================================================================
1. tried to change connection to raw mode for cluster connections
2. sh/c and sh/u are now sorted in alphabetical order
3. Limited the number of queued dx spots when composing messages to 20 (the 
oldest one is lost for every one added above 20).
4. Added generalised shell globbing everywhere I think it is useful, including
sh/dx, dir, sh/files etc
5. Made dir more compatible with ak1a and added 'to' and 'from' call searching
it should now do everything that ak1a does except counts.
6. added similar functionality to kill command so that you can kill ranges, to
and from callsigns etc.
22May99=======================================================================
1. added check for -1 from Date::Parse and return undef for out of range dates
2. added show/files and type commands
21May99=======================================================================
1. made set/nodx work again.
2. made dx stuff queue nicely again when sending messages.
18May99=======================================================================
1. Added announce dup checking.
2. Added system announce filtering.
08May99=======================================================================
1. Added a bit more checking to the rcmd thing to make more sure that this
rcmd isn't coming from an imposter. Not possible to prevent everything 
ofcourse, just make it a bit harder.
2. altered set/lockout and set/privilege so that they can't executed remotely.
3. Added some code to reject rubbish (with invalid binary characters) protocol
or user lines as input.
4. prevented PC command being executed remotely :-)
05May99=======================================================================
1. change the connection overlap from an abort to a disconnect.
02May99=======================================================================
1. Added the mechanism for doing user spot filtering for spots in the cluster 
(no user control just yet - but sysops can do it).
2. Fixed problem with nodes sending out the node lists of isolated nodes.
30Apr99=======================================================================
1. Try to make it even more AK1A friendly by putting the node list out in the
'correct' order.
2. added code so that local users and commands go to all connected nodes 
INCLUDING the isolated ones.
26Apr99=======================================================================
1. added set/user command as a hack, please use this with care, there is
very little checking.
2. added export_opernam.pl which is a basic reader of AK1A opernam.dat files
to stdout
25Apr99=======================================================================
1. Fixed problem with filtered spots not coming out.
2. Added the possibility of filtering on channel callsign
20Apr99=======================================================================
1. altered order of undefing and closing of user file in an attempt to make 
corruptions/missing users less likely.
2. made messages that are addressed to the node call appear to the alias call
3. check dates much more rigourously.
4. ignore SIGTERM and SIGINT during shutdown of the cluster
15Mar99=======================================================================
1. added $actiondata to filter line to allow per action data such as no of hops
2. fixed a silly problem in talk for non-existant callsigns
3. Added sysop command
02Mar99========================================================================
1. Changed DXUser so that it uses a homemade import/export hash routine 
2. DXUser now uses a DB_BTREE file
3. Added export_users.pl, import_users.pl and convert_users.pl
25Feb99========================================================================
1. added NL language stuff.
2. added set/language
21Feb99========================================================================
1. Allowed multiple 'on <freq>' for show/dx
2. Made sure the 'on 20m/ssb' thing worked (also 'on hf/cw').
3. first cut of the Filtering code, no user commands yet but the file
format is defined and manually added filters should work for spots
17Feb99========================================================================
1. added export_user.pl to export user files (for interest and safety)
2. changed DXUser::init to allow O_RDONLY access which may limit the number
of coredumps G0RDI seems to get.
15Feb99========================================================================
1. Added msg forwarding code which uses $main::root/msg/forward.pl.
14Feb99========================================================================
1. Changed A & K in WWV to be the other way around (I am told by G3IOR that
this will mean that we won't have pole to pole aurora nor all the power lines
overloading everywhere as well as a result of having values of K > 10).
2. allow the '~' character in message bodies.
3. Moved $main::data/badmsg.pl to $main::root/msg/badmsg.pl.
11Feb99========================================================================
1. Fixed a problem with isolated nodes' configurations being sent on sending 
local configs to new connections.
08Feb99========================================================================
1. added a $SIG{ALRM} in the client to actually catch the alarm when it goes 
off which means that the netrom/ax25 call programs terminate properly (and not
loop as fast as their little legs can paddle, soaking up CPU time).
2. Implemented read receipts as an especial request from G4PDQ.
3. Fiddled with DXUser a bit to see whether I can stop it core dumping on new
users in PC16s on G0RDI's machine.
4. Added E4 (Palestine) to Prefix data.
30Jan99========================================================================
1. Some of the dates we get can cause crashes, tried to make it more robust (oh
and Y2K compliant)
2. PC16 seem to come in with missing callsigns from somewhere
3. added $main::data/baddx.pl which prevents callsigns that are in the list being
a) forwarded b) stored and c) (except for the originator, if local) being
displayed locally.
4. added $main::data/badmsg.pl which deletes any messages whose TO address is
in this list (this is largely for european sensibilities). 
18Jan99========================================================================
1. added present(),presentish() and disconnect() to DXCron so that you can see 
(easily) if a station is on the cluster anywhere and also disconnect them
locally. 
2. added rcmd() to DXCron so you can send an rcmd to someone else from crontab.
3. <embarrassment>Fixed create_sysop.pl so that longitude is spelt correctly
there as well</embarrassment> made the update work properly. NOTE create_sysop
will only do what you expect if all cluster.pl and client.pl programs are 
stopped.
4. DXCron wasn't reading in reliably on startup, this is now (hopefully) fixed.
the -M semantics are rather strange!
5. The -w switch is now standard on cluster.pl
6. Added last_connect() which gives the last connect time of a user (or now
if connected).
7. Added present_on(call, node) and presentish_on(ditto) which returns true if 
the call is connected to the node.
8. incoming messages for users will now send a 'new message' message (instead
of merely generating the message)[who wrote this rubbish?].
9. Hooked $SIG{__WARN__} and $SIG{__DIE__} so we store these nasty error 
messages.
10. Print the no of users on restricted protocol links if we have had PC50
11. Had a go at making the sh/cl stats more accurate.
12. PC11 was trying to call Local::spot1 instead of Local::spot, no warning 
previously.
13. Added a simple lockfile to prevent more than one cluster running at a time
17Jan99========================================================================
1. fixed some permission problems on DXLog.
2. There is a circumstance in DXMsg which caused the cluster to stop on an 
null ref pointer which I can't get to the bottom of but have bandaided out 
for now.
3. Started filter and Database code.
4. Upper cased all the TO callsigns for sending to more than one station in
messages.
07Jan99========================================================================
1. Fixed Geomag after emacs reformatted it wrong so sh/wwv works again.
2. Added more range checking in WWV spots (they really are a heap of ...)
3. Changed create_sysop.pl so that you can update as well as create the user 
file
4. Remove spotter's SSID from WWV spots
06Jan99========================================================================
1. Do some range checking for spots and WWV in the future (got a WWV for Oct 
2034 whhich caused a bit of confusion!)
2. Make WWV spots broadcast them to the users! (as opposed to merely storing 
them)(thank you G0RDI).
3. Allow users to do show/announce (thank you JE1SGH).
4. Delay broadcasts to users if they are not in a 'prompt' state (means you can
add messages and see what you are doing on a busy system)
5. Made set/unset dx,ann,wx,talk,wwv do what is expected
6. added set/sys_location and set/set_qra to set the cluster lat/long and qra
7. New messages will now be announced on logon (if there are any)
03Jan99========================================================================
1. Upped the version no !!!!
2. made the DXProtocol routines much less sensitive to '~' characters (JE1SGH)
3. added '^' -> ':' conversions on ann, talk and dx commands
4. You can now send messages containing blank lines.
5. Fixed merge command problem reported by G0RDI
28Dec98========================================================================
1. Crossed fingers, got rid of the instabilities caused by execing programs
at vast speed (reduced it significantly anyway).
2. Personals will now move if homenode is known.
3. Added Local.pm for doing local specials
27Dec98========================================================================
1. Various detail changes to remove some more warning with -w on
2. Added DXCron handling - you can do crontabs now.
3. Added show/program command so you can see where it is loading your .pm files
from.
4. Added pc26/27 replies to locally connected cluster's merge (pc25) requests
5. Added spotters DXCC and original cluster to Spot data files.
23Dec98========================================================================
1. Reindented various things
2. Added missing $main::mycall on the end of outgoing PC11s (!)
3. Check that PC16/17 node calls really are nodes (AFAIAC).
22Dec98========================================================================
1. Added brackets round callsign if not here for prompt
2. Added Iain's set/password routine
3. Fixed sh/dx problems (the xemacs indent region messed Spot.pm up!)
4. Issued 1.15
21Dec98============= late! ====================================================
1. fixed problem with missing DXDebug in DXProt.
2. Fixed DXDebug so that it actually works as advertised with and without 
trailing \n. 
3. Added deduping of WWV spots as well (at for date,time,sfi,k and i) dups
4. Replaced the 0 in "02-Dec-1998" with ' ' so it reads " 2-Dec-1998", it seems
hard to credit it but some 'programs' out there that connect to clusters have
problems with the leading '0'!
5. In the same vain, included a strictly AK1A compatible sh/heading, apparently
this is necessary for the same reason as 4.
6. Started contrib tree stored the old show/heading in contrib/g0rdi/show.
7. Because I now correctly dedupe spots and wwv (there's a hostage to fortune..)
I have added a merge command. 
21Dec98========================================================================
1. Added "issue" to the client program for 'login' connections
2. Added more docs for client program.
3. Fixed problem introduced in 1.12 where a connect locally with a callsign of
someone connected remotely would stop the cluster.
4. issue release 1.13
20Dec98========================================================================
1. Removed all the warnings I get with perl -w (at least for just starting the
cluster and running a few commands).
2. Added per node hop control.
3. Added some docs on how to use it and isolation
4. Made talk command more intelligent in that if the user isn't seen and the
user's last node is visible it tries the talk anyway.
19Dec98========================================================================
1. Fixed problems with sh/rcmd (talk/ann/log) with a callsign as argument and
also made what G0RDI wanted work as well!
2. Added isolate flag to allow isolation of different networks at a gateway.
3. Changed make Makefile.PL to perl Makefile.PL in instructions
4. Copied latest instructions to html directory
5. Had another attempt at making clients disconnect without hanging everytime.
6. Changed msg queuing semantics so that the system routes on exact callsign.
7. Changed the protocol version so that it increments with the DXSpider version.
14Dec98========================================================================
1. Made the telnet thing work a bit better. It still will not work reliably to
a real telnetd on port 23.
2. Allowed network logins on client by specifying login instead of call.
3. made msg handling more robust (PC30 with unknown streams cause PC42), queueing
is only done on channels that are in state 'normal'.
4. Added pc command which takes a callsign and some text and sends it without
mods to the callsign, useful for sending manual PC protocol to unstick things.
Also for sending anonymous messages to online users.
5. Stopped duplicate messages being stored (it receives them and then bins them)
6. Implemented PC49 delete/full from outside (kill full on the inside)
7. Implemented the client command in connect scripts so that you can have 
different scripts for the same callsign.
8. Added sh/wwv command
13Dec98========================================================================
1. Fixed VS6 lat/long in prefix_data and wpxloc.raw
2. Sorted out last in times for remote users
3. editted and substitued G0RDI's version of the install instructions over
mine in spider/html
4. fixed telnet connections
5. added connect instructions to html tree.
6. Added some more help
7. Upissued version
12Dec98========================================================================
1. Incorporated sh/st, (un)set/lockout, forward/opername from Iain G0RDI
2. Added group handling with (un)set/group, show/group. This allows arbitrary
groups to be formed (for ann/<group> for example) and is also used to 'filter' 
spots, announces, wwvs etc into groups of cluster nodes (useful for creating 
disjoint cluster networks)
3. **** CHANGE mylongtitude to mylongitude in DXVars.pm ****
4. Altered QRA locator routines so they work correctly!
5. Fixed all commands that had the wrong mylat(itude) and mylong(itude) names
in.
07Dec98========================================================================
1. Added set/name, set/qra, set/location, set/qth, set/homenode, set/bbs, 
set/email
2. changed the Msg socket close to a shutdown (hopefully more reliable), this 
should stop clients hanging on exit.
3. Added Alias support for help
4. Added lltos and stoll routines to DXBearing
5. Added auto prompting for name, qth, location and homenode if any of these
aren't known.
06Dec98========================================================================
1. Fixed DXBearing::is_qra so that it correctly detects full QRA locators
2. Added sh/qra for doing locator distances and bearings
3. Added some stuff to Notes.txt on hints for command writers
4. Changed help system to use just one file per language
5. Started adding more help
6. Fixed 24Mhz band limits
7. Added apropos command and lots of new help text
05Dec98========================================================================
1. Added sh/heading and QRA locator calculation stuff
04Dec98========================================================================
1. Started Changes file
2. Added load/cmd_cache.pl to clear cmd cache shortcuts (use this if cluster.pl
get confused about where it is getting its commands from eg if you have
removed a file from local_cmd 'cos you want to go back to standard one)
3. Fixed bull handling at least to the extent that it stores them and
doesn't mess up the normal directory handling.
4. Fixed the unset/debug command so that it actually does the job!
5. Removed the middle line 'written in perl for unix' from show/version.pl
