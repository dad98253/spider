27Dec98========================================================================
1. Various detail changes to remove some more warning with -w on
2. Added DXCron handling - you can do crontabs now.
3. Added show/program command so you can see where it is loading your .pm files
from.
4. Added pc26/27 replies to locally connected cluster's merge (pc25) requests
5. Added spotters DXCC and original cluster to Spot data files.
23Dec98========================================================================
1. Reindented various things
2. Added missing $main::mycall on the end of outgoing PC11s (!)
3. Check that PC16/17 node calls really are nodes (AFAIAC).
22Dec98========================================================================
1. Added brackets round callsign if not here for prompt
2. Added Iain's set/password routine
3. Fixed sh/dx problems (the xemacs indent region messed Spot.pm up!)
4. Issued 1.15
21Dec98============= late! ====================================================
1. fixed problem with missing DXDebug in DXProt.
2. Fixed DXDebug so that it actually works as advertised with and without 
trailing \n. 
3. Added deduping of WWV spots as well (at for date,time,sfi,k and i) dups
4. Replaced the 0 in "02-Dec-1998" with ' ' so it reads " 2-Dec-1998", it seems
hard to credit it but some 'programs' out there that connect to clusters have
problems with the leading '0'!
5. In the same vain, included a strictly AK1A compatible sh/heading, apparently
this is necessary for the same reason as 4.
6. Started contrib tree stored the old show/heading in contrib/g0rdi/show.
7. Because I now correctly dedupe spots and wwv (there's a hostage to fortune..)
I have added a merge command. 
21Dec98========================================================================
1. Added "issue" to the client program for 'login' connections
2. Added more docs for client program.
3. Fixed problem introduced in 1.12 where a connect locally with a callsign of
someone connected remotely would stop the cluster.
4. issue release 1.13
20Dec98========================================================================
1. Removed all the warnings I get with perl -w (at least for just starting the
cluster and running a few commands).
2. Added per node hop control.
3. Added some docs on how to use it and isolation
4. Made talk command more intelligent in that if the user isn't seen and the
user's last node is visible it tries the talk anyway.
19Dec98========================================================================
1. Fixed problems with sh/rcmd (talk/ann/log) with a callsign as argument and
also made what G0RDI wanted work as well!
2. Added isolate flag to allow isolation of different networks at a gateway.
3. Changed make Makefile.PL to perl Makefile.PL in instructions
4. Copied latest instructions to html directory
5. Had another attempt at making clients disconnect without hanging everytime.
6. Changed msg queuing semantics so that the system routes on exact callsign.
7. Changed the protocol version so that it increments with the DXSpider version.
14Dec98========================================================================
1. Made the telnet thing work a bit better. It still will not work reliably to
a real telnetd on port 23.
2. Allowed network logins on client by specifying login instead of call.
3. made msg handling more robust (PC30 with unknown streams cause PC42), queueing
is only done on channels that are in state 'normal'.
4. Added pc command which takes a callsign and some text and sends it without
mods to the callsign, useful for sending manual PC protocol to unstick things.
Also for sending anonymous messages to online users.
5. Stopped duplicate messages being stored (it receives them and then bins them)
6. Implemented PC49 delete/full from outside (kill full on the inside)
7. Implemented the client command in connect scripts so that you can have 
different scripts for the same callsign.
8. Added sh/wwv command
13Dec98========================================================================
1. Fixed VS6 lat/long in prefix_data and wpxloc.raw
2. Sorted out last in times for remote users
3. editted and substitued G0RDI's version of the install instructions over
mine in spider/html
4. fixed telnet connections
5. added connect instructions to html tree.
6. Added some more help
7. Upissued version
12Dec98========================================================================
1. Incorporated sh/st, (un)set/lockout, forward/opername from Iain G0RDI
2. Added group handling with (un)set/group, show/group. This allows arbitrary
groups to be formed (for ann/<group> for example) and is also used to 'filter' 
spots, announces, wwvs etc into groups of cluster nodes (useful for creating 
disjoint cluster networks)
3. **** CHANGE mylongtitude to mylongitude in DXVars.pm ****
4. Altered QRA locator routines so they work correctly!
5. Fixed all commands that had the wrong mylat(itude) and mylong(itude) names
in.
07Dec98========================================================================
1. Added set/name, set/qra, set/location, set/qth, set/homenode, set/bbs, 
set/email
2. changed the Msg socket close to a shutdown (hopefully more reliable), this 
should stop clients hanging on exit.
3. Added Alias support for help
4. Added lltos and stoll routines to DXBearing
5. Added auto prompting for name, qth, location and homenode if any of these
aren't known.
06Dec98========================================================================
1. Fixed DXBearing::is_qra so that it correctly detects full QRA locators
2. Added sh/qra for doing locator distances and bearings
3. Added some stuff to Notes.txt on hints for command writers
4. Changed help system to use just one file per language
5. Started adding more help
6. Fixed 24Mhz band limits
7. Added apropos command and lots of new help text
05Dec98========================================================================
1. Added sh/heading and QRA locator calculation stuff
04Dec98========================================================================
1. Started Changes file
2. Added load/cmd_cache.pl to clear cmd cache shortcuts (use this if cluster.pl
get confused about where it is getting its commands from eg if you have
removed a file from local_cmd 'cos you want to go back to standard one)
3. Fixed bull handling at least to the extent that it stores them and
doesn't mess up the normal directory handling.
4. Fixed the unset/debug command so that it actually does the job!
5. Removed the middle line 'written in perl for unix' from show/version.pl
