25Apr99=======================================================================
1. Fixed problem with filtered spots not coming out.
2. Added the possibility of filtering on channel callsign
15Mar99=======================================================================
1. added $actiondata to filter line to allow per action data such as no of hops
2. fixed a silly problem in talk for non-existant callsigns
3. Added sysop command
02Mar99========================================================================
1. Changed DXUser so that it uses a homemade import/export hash routine 
2. DXUser now uses a DB_BTREE file
3. Added export_users.pl, import_users.pl and convert_users.pl
25Feb99========================================================================
1. added NL language stuff.
2. added set/language
21Feb99========================================================================
1. Allowed multiple 'on <freq>' for show/dx
2. Made sure the 'on 20m/ssb' thing worked (also 'on hf/cw').
3. first cut of the Filtering code, no user commands yet but the file
format is defined and manually added filters should work for spots
17Feb99========================================================================
1. added export_user.pl to export user files (for interest and safety)
2. changed DXUser::init to allow O_RDONLY access which may limit the number
of coredumps G0RDI seems to get.
15Feb99========================================================================
1. Added msg forwarding code which uses $main::root/msg/forward.pl.
14Feb99========================================================================
1. Changed A & K in WWV to be the other way around (I am told by G3IOR that
this will mean that we won't have pole to pole aurora nor all the power lines
overloading everywhere as well as a result of having values of K > 10).
2. allow the '~' character in message bodies.
3. Moved $main::data/badmsg.pl to $main::root/msg/badmsg.pl.
11Feb99========================================================================
1. Fixed a problem with isolated nodes' configurations being sent on sending 
local configs to new connections.
08Feb99========================================================================
1. added a $SIG{ALRM} in the client to actually catch the alarm when it goes 
off which means that the netrom/ax25 call programs terminate properly (and not
loop as fast as their little legs can paddle, soaking up CPU time).
2. Implemented read receipts as an especial request from G4PDQ.
3. Fiddled with DXUser a bit to see whether I can stop it core dumping on new
users in PC16s on G0RDI's machine.
4. Added E4 (Palestine) to Prefix data.
30Jan99========================================================================
1. Some of the dates we get can cause crashes, tried to make it more robust (oh
and Y2K compliant)
2. PC16 seem to come in with missing callsigns from somewhere
3. added $main::data/baddx.pl which prevents callsigns that are in the list being
a) forwarded b) stored and c) (except for the originator, if local) being
displayed locally.
4. added $main::data/badmsg.pl which deletes any messages whose TO address is
in this list (this is largely for european sensibilities). 
18Jan99========================================================================
1. added present(),presentish() and disconnect() to DXCron so that you can see 
(easily) if a station is on the cluster anywhere and also disconnect them
locally. 
2. added rcmd() to DXCron so you can send an rcmd to someone else from crontab.
3. <embarrassment>Fixed create_sysop.pl so that longitude is spelt correctly
there as well</embarrassment> made the update work properly. NOTE create_sysop
will only do what you expect if all cluster.pl and client.pl programs are 
stopped.
4. DXCron wasn't reading in reliably on startup, this is now (hopefully) fixed.
the -M semantics are rather strange!
5. The -w switch is now standard on cluster.pl
6. Added last_connect() which gives the last connect time of a user (or now
if connected).
7. Added present_on(call, node) and presentish_on(ditto) which returns true if 
the call is connected to the node.
8. incoming messages for users will now send a 'new message' message (instead
of merely generating the message)[who wrote this rubbish?].
9. Hooked $SIG{__WARN__} and $SIG{__DIE__} so we store these nasty error 
messages.
10. Print the no of users on restricted protocol links if we have had PC50
11. Had a go at making the sh/cl stats more accurate.
12. PC11 was trying to call Local::spot1 instead of Local::spot, no warning 
previously.
13. Added a simple lockfile to prevent more than one cluster running at a time
17Jan99========================================================================
1. fixed some permission problems on DXLog.
2. There is a circumstance in DXMsg which caused the cluster to stop on an 
null ref pointer which I can't get to the bottom of but have bandaided out 
for now.
3. Started filter and Database code.
4. Upper cased all the TO callsigns for sending to more than one station in
messages.
07Jan99========================================================================
1. Fixed Geomag after emacs reformatted it wrong so sh/wwv works again.
2. Added more range checking in WWV spots (they really are a heap of ...)
3. Changed create_sysop.pl so that you can update as well as create the user 
file
4. Remove spotter's SSID from WWV spots
06Jan99========================================================================
1. Do some range checking for spots and WWV in the future (got a WWV for Oct 
2034 whhich caused a bit of confusion!)
2. Make WWV spots broadcast them to the users! (as opposed to merely storing 
them)(thank you G0RDI).
3. Allow users to do show/announce (thank you JE1SGH).
4. Delay broadcasts to users if they are not in a 'prompt' state (means you can
add messages and see what you are doing on a busy system)
5. Made set/unset dx,ann,wx,talk,wwv do what is expected
6. added set/sys_location and set/set_qra to set the cluster lat/long and qra
7. New messages will now be announced on logon (if there are any)
03Jan99========================================================================
1. Upped the version no !!!!
2. made the DXProtocol routines much less sensitive to '~' characters (JE1SGH)
3. added '^' -> ':' conversions on ann, talk and dx commands
4. You can now send messages containing blank lines.
5. Fixed merge command problem reported by G0RDI
28Dec98========================================================================
1. Crossed fingers, got rid of the instabilities caused by execing programs
at vast speed (reduced it significantly anyway).
2. Personals will now move if homenode is known.
3. Added Local.pm for doing local specials
27Dec98========================================================================
1. Various detail changes to remove some more warning with -w on
2. Added DXCron handling - you can do crontabs now.
3. Added show/program command so you can see where it is loading your .pm files
from.
4. Added pc26/27 replies to locally connected cluster's merge (pc25) requests
5. Added spotters DXCC and original cluster to Spot data files.
23Dec98========================================================================
1. Reindented various things
2. Added missing $main::mycall on the end of outgoing PC11s (!)
3. Check that PC16/17 node calls really are nodes (AFAIAC).
22Dec98========================================================================
1. Added brackets round callsign if not here for prompt
2. Added Iain's set/password routine
3. Fixed sh/dx problems (the xemacs indent region messed Spot.pm up!)
4. Issued 1.15
21Dec98============= late! ====================================================
1. fixed problem with missing DXDebug in DXProt.
2. Fixed DXDebug so that it actually works as advertised with and without 
trailing \n. 
3. Added deduping of WWV spots as well (at for date,time,sfi,k and i) dups
4. Replaced the 0 in "02-Dec-1998" with ' ' so it reads " 2-Dec-1998", it seems
hard to credit it but some 'programs' out there that connect to clusters have
problems with the leading '0'!
5. In the same vain, included a strictly AK1A compatible sh/heading, apparently
this is necessary for the same reason as 4.
6. Started contrib tree stored the old show/heading in contrib/g0rdi/show.
7. Because I now correctly dedupe spots and wwv (there's a hostage to fortune..)
I have added a merge command. 
21Dec98========================================================================
1. Added "issue" to the client program for 'login' connections
2. Added more docs for client program.
3. Fixed problem introduced in 1.12 where a connect locally with a callsign of
someone connected remotely would stop the cluster.
4. issue release 1.13
20Dec98========================================================================
1. Removed all the warnings I get with perl -w (at least for just starting the
cluster and running a few commands).
2. Added per node hop control.
3. Added some docs on how to use it and isolation
4. Made talk command more intelligent in that if the user isn't seen and the
user's last node is visible it tries the talk anyway.
19Dec98========================================================================
1. Fixed problems with sh/rcmd (talk/ann/log) with a callsign as argument and
also made what G0RDI wanted work as well!
2. Added isolate flag to allow isolation of different networks at a gateway.
3. Changed make Makefile.PL to perl Makefile.PL in instructions
4. Copied latest instructions to html directory
5. Had another attempt at making clients disconnect without hanging everytime.
6. Changed msg queuing semantics so that the system routes on exact callsign.
7. Changed the protocol version so that it increments with the DXSpider version.
14Dec98========================================================================
1. Made the telnet thing work a bit better. It still will not work reliably to
a real telnetd on port 23.
2. Allowed network logins on client by specifying login instead of call.
3. made msg handling more robust (PC30 with unknown streams cause PC42), queueing
is only done on channels that are in state 'normal'.
4. Added pc command which takes a callsign and some text and sends it without
mods to the callsign, useful for sending manual PC protocol to unstick things.
Also for sending anonymous messages to online users.
5. Stopped duplicate messages being stored (it receives them and then bins them)
6. Implemented PC49 delete/full from outside (kill full on the inside)
7. Implemented the client command in connect scripts so that you can have 
different scripts for the same callsign.
8. Added sh/wwv command
13Dec98========================================================================
1. Fixed VS6 lat/long in prefix_data and wpxloc.raw
2. Sorted out last in times for remote users
3. editted and substitued G0RDI's version of the install instructions over
mine in spider/html
4. fixed telnet connections
5. added connect instructions to html tree.
6. Added some more help
7. Upissued version
12Dec98========================================================================
1. Incorporated sh/st, (un)set/lockout, forward/opername from Iain G0RDI
2. Added group handling with (un)set/group, show/group. This allows arbitrary
groups to be formed (for ann/<group> for example) and is also used to 'filter' 
spots, announces, wwvs etc into groups of cluster nodes (useful for creating 
disjoint cluster networks)
3. **** CHANGE mylongtitude to mylongitude in DXVars.pm ****
4. Altered QRA locator routines so they work correctly!
5. Fixed all commands that had the wrong mylat(itude) and mylong(itude) names
in.
07Dec98========================================================================
1. Added set/name, set/qra, set/location, set/qth, set/homenode, set/bbs, 
set/email
2. changed the Msg socket close to a shutdown (hopefully more reliable), this 
should stop clients hanging on exit.
3. Added Alias support for help
4. Added lltos and stoll routines to DXBearing
5. Added auto prompting for name, qth, location and homenode if any of these
aren't known.
06Dec98========================================================================
1. Fixed DXBearing::is_qra so that it correctly detects full QRA locators
2. Added sh/qra for doing locator distances and bearings
3. Added some stuff to Notes.txt on hints for command writers
4. Changed help system to use just one file per language
5. Started adding more help
6. Fixed 24Mhz band limits
7. Added apropos command and lots of new help text
05Dec98========================================================================
1. Added sh/heading and QRA locator calculation stuff
04Dec98========================================================================
1. Started Changes file
2. Added load/cmd_cache.pl to clear cmd cache shortcuts (use this if cluster.pl
get confused about where it is getting its commands from eg if you have
removed a file from local_cmd 'cos you want to go back to standard one)
3. Fixed bull handling at least to the extent that it stores them and
doesn't mess up the normal directory handling.
4. Fixed the unset/debug command so that it actually does the job!
5. Removed the middle line 'written in perl for unix' from show/version.pl
