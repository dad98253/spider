   SHOW/PREFIX <prefix> or <callsign>
   
   This command takes the <prefix> (which can be a full or partial 
   callsign if desired), looks up which internal country number it is
   and then displays all the relevant prefixes for that country
   together with the internal country no, the CQ and ITU regions.
