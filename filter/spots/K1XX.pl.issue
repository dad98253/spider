# This is an example filter for the 'isolated' node k1xx
# 
# I give him any spots that have a spotter or a spotted in the
# US. In other filters on the UK side I do the opposite see 
# GB7DJK.pl.issue
##
# the elements of each list are 
#
# [action, field_no, sort, possible_values, hops]
#
# where:-
#
#   action is 1 or 0 
# 
#   the field list is:-
#      0 = frequency
#      1 = call
#      2 = date in unix format
#      3 = comment
#      4 = spotter
#      5 = spotted dxcc country
#      6 = spotter's dxcc country
#      7 = origin
#      8 = spotted itu
#      9 = spotted cq
#      10 = spotter's itu
#      11 = spotter's cq
#      12 = callsign of the channel on which the spot has appeared
#
#   sort is
#     n - numeric list of numbers e.g. [ 1,2,3 ]
#     r - ranges of pairs of numbers e.g. between 2 and 4 or 10 to 17 - [ 2,4, 10,17 ] 
#     a - an alphanumeric regex
#     d - the default rule
#
#   if hops is left out or zero then the existing hop count will be used as normal
#
# The spot data (in this case '15') is the used as the hop count
# if this is missing then the normal default applies
#

$in = [
	   [ 1, 5, 'n', [ 226 ], 15 ],         # dxcc country 226 is the US
	   [ 1, 6, 'a', [ 226 ], 15 ],
       [ 0, 0, 'd' ],                  # default action (don't forward)
