#
# This is an example WWV filter
# 
# The element list is:-
# 0 - nominal unix date of spot (ie the day + hour:13)
# 1 - the hour
# 2 - SFI
# 3 - K
# 4 - I
# 5 - text
# 6 - spotter
# 7 - origin
# 8 - incoming interface callsign
#
# this one doesn't filter, it just sets the hop count to 6 and is
# used mainly just to override any isolation from WWV coming from
# the internet.

$in = [
        [ 1, 0, 'd', 0, 6 ]
