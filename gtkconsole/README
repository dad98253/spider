How to install and use Gtkconsole
---------------------------------

For Linux users:-

Please make sure that you have the following perl packages loaded:-

* Gtk2

this is best obtained from your distro's packaging system. For
Ubuntu/Debian users, something like (as root or via sudo):-

  aptitude install libgtk2-perl

or for Fedora users:-

  yum install perl-Gtk2 perl-Gtk2-Ex-Simple-List perl-Gtk2-Ex-Utils

For Windows Users:-

This is a bit more complicated but you should either follow the instructions
on:-

  http://www.lostmind.de/gtk2-perl/

The important thing is that you should be running an activestate perl
in the 5.8 series. It may work with an earlier 5.6.1 build but I now
longer have the where withall to test it. Now would be a good time to
upgrade to the perl suggested on the webpage. The link points directly
to the activestate download site.

You do need the GTK+ runtime.
You don't need Glade.

Follow the instructions in "Installation instructions" and you are
strongly advised to use the method outlined in 2a) and not 2b).

Don't bother with running gtk-demo.

I am using a slightly earlier activestate perl than build 819, mine is
build 815. It still seems to work for me.

Running the program:-

  cd /spider/gtkconsole
  perl gtkconsole

This should work if you are running it on the same machine as the
cluster.  Otherwise, if you get errors try:-

  perl gtkconsole <your sysop call> localhost 7300

where localhost and 7300 are the IP address and port of the cluster
you want to use.

The interface is very basic at the moment, but it will improve and get
added to as time permits.

You will notice that various windows will popup automatically as data
for those windows arrives. You can't stop at the moment. It is a
feature.

Please report problems and feature requests to the dxspider-support
list.
