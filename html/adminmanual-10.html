<H2><A NAME="s10">10. The DXSpider command set</A></H2>

<P>Below is a complete list of commands available from the cluster prompt.
Most maintenance tasks are automatic but there are some commands that are useful 
for a sysop.  These are listed below in alphabetical order.  The number in 
brackets following the command name is the permissions level needed to use 
the command.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss10.1">10.1 accept/announce (0)</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE><B>accept/announce [0-9] &lt;pattern&gt;</B> Set an accept filter
line for announce</CODE>
<P>
<P>Create an 'accept this announce' line for a filter. 
<P>An accept filter line means that if the announce matches this filter it is
passed onto the user. See HELP FILTERS for more info. Please read this
to understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief later on.
<P>You can use any of the following things in this line:-

<P>For frequencies, you can use any of the band names defined in
SHOW/BANDS and you can use a subband name like: cw, rtty, data, ssb -
thus: hf/ssb. You can also just have a simple range like: 0/30000 -
this is more efficient than saying simply: freq HF (but don't get
too hung up about that)

<P>When you send messages the fact that you have forwarded it to another node 
is remembered so that it isn't sent again. When you have a new partner
node and you add their callsign to your /spider/msg/forward.pl file, all
outstanding non-private messages will be forwarded to them. This may well
be ALL the non-private messages. You can prevent this by using these 
commmands:-

</H2>

<P><CODE><B>dbavail</B> Show a list of all the databases in the system</CODE>

<P>The title says it all really, this command lists all the databases defined

<B>dbcreate &lt;name&gt; remote &lt;node&gt;</B> Create a remote database
entry<BR></CODE>
<P>
<P>DBCREATE allows you to define a database in the system. It doesn't actually
create anything, just defines it.
<P>The databases that are created are simple DB_File hash databases, they are 
therefore already 'indexed'.
<P>You can define a local database with the first form of the command eg:
<P>DBCREATE oblast
<P>You can also chain databases with the addition of the 'chain' keyword. 
This will search each database one after the other. A typical example 
is:
<P>DBCREATE sdx_qsl chain sql_ad
<P>No checking is done to see if the any of the chained databases exist, in
fact it is usually better to do the above statement first then do each of
the chained databases.
<P>Databases can exist offsite. To define a database that lives on another 
node do:
<P>DBCREATE buckmaster remote gb7dxc
<P>Remote databases cannot be chained; however, the last database in a 
a chain can be a remote database eg:
<P>DBCREATE qsl chain gb7dxc
<P>To see what databases have been defined do:
<P>DBAVAIL (or it will have been aliased to SHOW/COMMAND)
<P>It would be normal for you to add an entry into your local Aliases file
to allow people to use the 'SHOW/&lt;dbname&gt;' style syntax. So you would
need to add a line like:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<P>If you want to import or update data in bulk to a database you can use
this command. It will either create or update entries into an existing
database. For example:-
<P>DBIMPORT oblast /tmp/OBLAST.FUL

<P>There is no warning, no comeback, no safety net. 
<P>For example:
<P>DBREMOVE oblast 
<P>will remove the oblast database from the system and it will also remove
the associated datafile.

<P><CODE><B>dbshow &lt;dbname&gt; &lt;key&gt;</B> Display an entry, if it exists, in a database</CODE>
<P>
<P>This is the generic user interface to the database to the database system.
It is expected that the sysop will add an entry to the local Aliases file
so that users can use the more familiar AK1A style of enquiry such as:

<H2><A NAME="ss10.39">10.39 filtering (0)</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE><B>filtering</B> Filtering things in DXSpider</CODE>
<P>
<P>There are a number of things you can filter in the DXSpider system. They
all use the same general mechanism.
<P>In general terms you can create a 'reject' or an 'accept' filter which
can have up to 10 lines in it. You do this using, for example:-
<P>accept/spots .....
reject/spots .....
<P>where ..... are the specific commands for that type of filter. There
are filters for spots, wwv, announce, wcy and (for sysops)
connects. See each different accept or reject command reference for
more details.
<P>There is also a command to clear out one or more lines in a filter and
one to show you what you have set. They are:-
<P>clear/spots 1
clear/spots all
<P>and 
<P>show/filter
<P>There is clear/xxxx command for each type of filter.
<P>For now we are going to use spots for the examples, but you can apply
the principles to all types of filter.
<P>There are two main types of filter 'accept' or 'reject'; which you use
depends entirely on how you look at the world and what is least
writing to achieve what you want. Each filter has 10 lines (of any
length) which are tried in order. If a line matches then the action
you have specified is taken (ie reject means ignore it and accept
means gimme it).
<P>The important thing to remember is that if you specify a 'reject'
filter (all the lines in it say 'reject/spots' (for instance) then if
a spot comes in that doesn't match any of the lines then you will get
it BUT if you specify an 'accept' filter then any spots that don't
match are dumped. For example if I have a one line accept filter:-
<P>accept/spots on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)
<P>then automatically you will ONLY get VHF spots from or to CQ zones 14
15 and 16.  If you set a reject filter like:
<P>reject/spots on hf/cw
<P>Then you will get everything EXCEPT HF CW spots, If you am interested in IOTA
and will work it even on CW then you could say:-
<P>reject/spots on hf/cw and not info iota
<P>But in that case you might only be interested in iota and say:-
<P>accept/spots not on hf/cw or info iota
<P>which is exactly the same. You should choose one or the other until
you are confortable with the way it works. Yes, you can mix them
(actually you can have an accept AND a reject on the same line) but
don't try this at home until you can analyse the results that you get
without ringing up the sysop for help.
<P>You can arrange your filter lines into logical units, either for your
own understanding or simply convenience. I have one set frequently:-
<P>reject/spots 1 on hf/cw
reject/spots 2 on 50000/1400000 not (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)  
<P>What this does is to ignore all HF CW spots (being a class B I can't
read any CW and couldn't possibly be interested in HF :-) and also
rejects any spots on VHF which don't either originate or spot someone
in Europe.
<P>This is an exmaple where you would use the line number (1 and 2 in
this case), if you leave the digit out, the system assumes '1'. Digits
'0'-'9' are available.
<P>You can leave the word 'and' out if you want, it is implied. You can
use any number of brackets to make the 'expression' as you want
it. There are things called precedence rules working here which mean
that you will NEED brackets in a situation like line 2 because,
without it, will assume:-
<P>(on 50000/1400000 and by_zone 14,15,16) or call_zone 14,15,16 
<P>annoying, but that is the way it is. If you use OR - use
brackets. Whilst we are here CASE is not important. 'And BY_Zone' is
just 'and by_zone'.
<P>If you want to alter your filter you can just redefine one or more
lines of it or clear out one line. For example:-
<P>reject/spots 1 on hf/ssb
<P>or 
<P>clear/spots 1
<P>To remove the filter in its entirty:-
<P>clear/spots all
<P>There are similar CLEAR commands for the other filters:-
<P>clear/announce
clear/wcy
clear/wwv
<P>ADVANCED USERS:-
<P>Once you are happy with the results you get, you may like to experiment. 
<P>my example that filters hf/cw spots and accepts vhf/uhf spots from EU
can be written with a mixed filter, eg:
<P>rej/spot on hf/cw
acc/spot on 0/30000
acc/spot 2 on 50000/1400000 and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)
<P>each filter slot actually has a 'reject' slot and an 'accept'
slot. The reject slot is executed BEFORE the accept slot.
<P>It was mentioned earlier that after a reject test that doesn't match,
the default for following tests is 'accept', the reverse is true for
'accept'. In the example what happens is that the reject is executed
first, any non hf/cw spot is passed to the accept line, which lets
thru everything else on HF.
<P>The next filter line lets through just VHF/UHF spots from EU.

</H2>

<P><CODE><B>forward/latlong &lt;node_call&gt;</B> Send latitude and longitude information to another cluster</CODE>
<P>
<P>This command sends all the latitude and longitude information that your
cluster is holding against callsigns.  One advantage of recieving this
information is that more locator information is held by you.  This
means that more locators are given on the DX line assuming you have
<EM>set/dxgrid</EM> enabled.  This could be a LOT of information though, so
it is not recommended on slow links.

<P>
<P>This command attempts to re-initialise a link to a (usually) AK1A node
that has got confused, usually by a protocol loop of some kind. It may
work - but you usually will be better off simply disconnecting it (or
better, if it is a real AK1A node, doing an RCMD &lt;node&gt; DISC/F &lt;your

<P>Create a 'reject this spot' line for a filter. 
<P>A reject filter line means that if the spot matches this filter it is
dumped (not passed on). See HELP FILTERS for more info. Please read this
to understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief later on.
<P>You can use any of the following things in this line:-

  freq &lt;range>           eg: 0/30000 or hf or hf/cw or 6m,4m,2m

<P>For frequencies, you can use any of the band names defined in
SHOW/BANDS and you can use a subband name like: cw, rtty, data, ssb -
thus: hf/ssb. You can also just have a simple range like: 0/30000 -
this is more efficient than saying simply: on HF (but don't get
too hung up about that)

<P>
<P>From version 1.35 onwards neighbouring nodes are pinged at regular intervals (see
SET/PINGINTERVAL), usually 300 seconds or 5 minutes. There is a 'pump-up'
counter which is decremented on every outgoing ping and then reset to
the 'obscount' value on every incoming ping. The default value of this
parameter is 2. 
<P>What this means is that a neighbouring node will be pinged twice at 
(default) 300 second intervals and if no reply has been heard just before
what would be the third attempt, that node is disconnected.
<P>If a ping is heard then the obscount is reset to the full value. Using
default values, if a node has not responded to a ping within 15 minutes,
it is disconnected.

affect routing decisions. The default interval is 300 secs or 5 minutes.
<P>You can use this command to set a different interval. Please don't. 
<P>But if you do the value you enter is treated as minutes up 60 and seconds

the likely propagation to &lt;prefix&gt;</CODE>
<P>
<P>This command allow you to estimate the likelihood of you contacting
a station with the prefix you have specified. The output assumes a modest
power of 20dBW and receiver sensitivity of -123dBm (about 0.15muV/10dB SINAD)
<P>The result predicts the most likely operating frequencies and signal
levels for high frequency (shortwave) radio propagation paths on
specified days of the year and hours of the day. It is most useful for
paths between 250 km and 6000 km, but can be used with reduced accuracy
for paths shorter or longer than this.
<P>The command uses a routine MINIMUF 3.5 developed by the U.S. Navy and
used to predict the MUF given the predicted flux, day of the year,
hour of the day and geographic coordinates of the transmitter and
receiver. This routine is reasonably accurate for the purposes here,
with a claimed RMS error of 3.8 MHz, but much smaller and less complex
than the programs used by major shortwave broadcasting organizations,
such as the Voice of America.
<P>The command will display some header information detailing its
assumptions, together with the locations, latitude and longitudes and
bearings. It will then show UTC (UT), local time at the other end
(LT), calculate the MUFs, Sun zenith angle at the midpoint of the path
(Zen) and the likely signal strengths. Then for each frequency for which
the system thinks there is a likelihood of a circuit it prints a value.
<P>The value is currently a likely S meter reading based on the conventional
6dB / S point scale. If the value has a '+' appended it means that it is
1/2 an S point stronger. If the value is preceeded by an 'm' it means that
there is likely to be much fading and by an 's' that the signal is likely
to be noisy.  
<P>By default SHOW/MUF will show the next two hours worth of data. You
can specify anything up to 24 hours worth of data by appending the no of
hours required after the prefix. For example:-

<P><CODE><B>show/satellite &lt;name&gt; [&lt;hours&gt; &lt;interval&gt;]</B>
Show satellite tracking data</CODE>
<P>
<P>Show the tracking data from your location to the satellite of your choice
from now on for the next few hours.
<P>If you use this command without a satellite name it will display a list
of all the satellites known currently to the system. 
<P>If you give a name then you can obtain tracking data of all the passes
that start and finish 5 degrees below the horizon. As default it will
give information for the next three hours for every five minute period.
<P>You can alter the number of hours and the step size, within certain 
limits. 
<P>Each pass in a period is separated with a row of '-----' characters
<P>So for example:-

<P>
<P>Show the sun rise and set times for a (list of) prefixes or callsigns, 
together with the azimuth and elevation of the sun currently at those

<P>If you don't specify any prefixes or callsigns, it will show the times for
your QTH (assuming you have set it with either SET/LOCATION or SET/QRA),
together with the current azimuth and elevation.
<P>If all else fails it will show the sunrise and set times for the node
that you are connected to.

</H2>

<P><CODE><B>sysop</B> Regain your privileges if you login remotely</CODE>
<P>
<P>The system automatically reduces your privilege level to that of a
normal user if you login in remotely. This command allows you to
regain your normal privilege level. It uses the normal system: five
numbers are returned that are indexes into the character array that is
your assigned password (see SET/PASSWORD). The indexes start from
zero.
<P>You are expected to return a string which contains the characters
required in the correct order. You may intersperse those characters
with others to obscure your reply for any watchers. For example (and
these values are for explanation :-):

numbers but nothing will happen when you input a string. Any match is
case sensitive.

<B>talk &lt;callsign&gt; &gt; &lt;node_call&gt; [&lt;text&gt;]</B>
Send a text message to &lt;callsign&gt; via &lt;node_call&gt;</CODE>
<P>
<P>Send a short message to any other station that is visible on the cluster
system. You can send it to anyone you can see with a SHOW/CONFIGURATION 
command, they don't have to be connected locally.
<P>The second form of TALK is used when other cluster nodes are connected
with restricted information. This usually means that they don't send 
the user information usually associated with logging on and off the cluster.
<P>If you know that G3JNB is likely to be present on GB7TLH, but you can only
see GB7TLH in the SH/C list but with no users, then you would use the
second form of the talk message.
<P>If you want to have a ragchew with someone you can leave the text message
out and the system will go into 'Talk' mode. What this means is that a
short message is sent to the recipient telling them that you are in a 'Talking' 
frame of mind and then you just type - everything you send will go to the 
station that you asked for. 
<P>All the usual announcements, spots and so on will still come out on your
terminal.
<P>If you want to do something (such as send a spot) you precede the normal 
command with a '/' character, eg:-
