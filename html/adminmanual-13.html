<H2><A NAME="s13">13. The DXSpider command set</A></H2>

<P>Below is a complete list of commands available from the cluster prompt.
Most maintenance tasks are automatic but there are some commands that are useful 
for a sysop.  These are listed below in alphabetical order.  The number in 
brackets following the command name is the permissions level needed to use 
the command.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.1">13.1 accept/announce (0)</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE><B>accept/announce [0-9] &lt;pattern&gt;</B> Set an accept filter
line for announce</CODE>
<P>
<P>Create an 'accept this announce' line for a filter. 
<P>An accept filter line means that if the announce matches this filter it is
passed onto the user. See HELP FILTERS for more info. Please read this
to understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief later on.
<P>You can use any of the following things in this line:-

</H2>

<P><CODE><B>accept/announce &lt;call&gt; [input] [0-9]&lt;pattern&gt;</B> Announce filter sysop version</CODE>
<P>
<P>This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as the

<P><CODE><B>accept/announce [0-9] &lt;pattern&gt;</B> Set an accept filter line for spots</CODE>
<P>
<P>Create an 'accept this spot' line for a filter.
<P>
<P>An accept filter line means that if the spot matches this filter it is
passed onto the user. See HELP FILTERS for more info. Please read this
to understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief later on.
<P>You can use any of the following things in this line:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<P>
<P>For frequencies, you can use any of the band names defined in
SHOW/BANDS and you can use a subband name like: cw, rtty, data, ssb -
thus: hf/ssb. You can also just have a simple range like: 0/30000 -
this is more efficient than saying simply: freq HF (but don't get
too hung up about that)

<P><CODE><B>catchup &lt;node_call&gt; All|[&lt;msgno&gt; ...]</B> Mark a message as sent</CODE>
<P>
<P>When you send messages the fact that you have forwarded it to another node 
is remembered so that it isn't sent again. When you have a new partner
node and you add their callsign to your /spider/msg/forward.pl file, all
outstanding non-private messages will be forwarded to them. This may well
be ALL the non-private messages. You can prevent this by using these 
commmands:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  catchup GB7DJK all
  catchup GB7DJK 300 301 302 303 500-510
</PRE>

<P>and to undo what you have just done:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  uncatchup GB7DJK all
  uncatchup GB7DJK 300 301 302 303 500-510

<H2><A NAME="ss13.15">13.15 clear/spots (0)</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE><B>clear/spots [1|all]</B> Clear a spot filter line</CODE>
<P>
<P>This command allows you to clear (remove) a line in a spot filter or to 
remove the whole filter.
<P>If you have a filter:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  acc/spot 1 on hf/cw
  acc/spot 2 on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and you say:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  clear/spot 1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>you will be left with:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  acc/spot 2 on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If you do:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  clear/spot all
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>the filter will be completely removed.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.16">13.16 connect (5) </A>
</H2>

<P><CODE><B>connect &lt;callsign&gt;</B> Start a connection to another DX Cluster</CODE>
<P>
<P>Start a connection process that will culminate in a new connection to the
DX cluster &lt;callsign&gt;. This process creates a new 'client' process which will
use the script in /spider/connect/&lt;callsign&gt; to effect the 'chat' exchange
necessary to traverse the network(s) to logon to the cluster &lt;callsign&gt;.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.17">13.17 dbavail (0)</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE><B>dbavail</B> Show a list of all the databases in the system</CODE>
<P>
<P>The title says it all really, this command lists all the databases defined
in the system. It is also aliased to SHOW/COMMAND.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.18">13.18 dbcreate (9)</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE><B>dbcreate &lt;name&gt;</B> Create a database entry<BR>
<B>dbcreate &lt;name&gt; chain &lt;name&gt; [&lt;name&gt;..]</B> Create a chained database entry<BR>
<B>dbcreate &lt;name&gt; remote &lt;node&gt;</B> Create a remote database
entry<BR></CODE>
<P>
<P>DBCREATE allows you to define a database in the system. It doesn't actually
create anything, just defines it.
<P>The databases that are created are simple DB_File hash databases, they are 
therefore already 'indexed'.
<P>You can define a local database with the first form of the command eg:
<P>DBCREATE oblast
<P>You can also chain databases with the addition of the 'chain' keyword. 
This will search each database one after the other. A typical example 
is:
<P>DBCREATE sdx_qsl chain sql_ad
<P>No checking is done to see if the any of the chained databases exist, in
fact it is usually better to do the above statement first then do each of
the chained databases.
<P>Databases can exist offsite. To define a database that lives on another 
node do:
<P>DBCREATE buckmaster remote gb7dxc
<P>Remote databases cannot be chained; however, the last database in a 
a chain can be a remote database eg:
<P>DBCREATE qsl chain gb7dxc
<P>To see what databases have been defined do:
<P>DBAVAIL (or it will have been aliased to SHOW/COMMAND)
<P>It would be normal for you to add an entry into your local Aliases file
to allow people to use the 'SHOW/&lt;dbname&gt;' style syntax. So you would
need to add a line like:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  's' => [
    ..
    ..
    '^sh\w*/buc', 'dbshow buckmaster', 'dbshow',
    ..
    ..
   ],
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>to allow 
<P>SH/BUCK g1tlh
<P>to work as they may be used to.
<P>See DBIMPORT for the importing of existing AK1A format data to databases.
See DBSHOW for generic database enquiry
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.19">13.19 dbimport (9)</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE><B>dbimport &lt;dbname&gt;</B> Import AK1A data into a database</CODE>
<P>
<P>If you want to import or update data in bulk to a database you can use
this command. It will either create or update entries into an existing
database. For example:-
<P>DBIMPORT oblast /tmp/OBLAST.FUL
<P>will import the standard OBLAST database that comes with AK1A into the
oblast database held locally.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.20">13.20 dbremove (9)</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE><B>dbremove &lt;dbname&gt;</B> Delete a database</CODE>
<P>
<P>DBREMOVE will completely remove a database entry and also delete any data
file that is associated with it. 
<P>There is no warning, no comeback, no safety net. 
<P>For example:
<P>DBREMOVE oblast 
<P>will remove the oblast database from the system and it will also remove
the associated datafile.
<P>I repeat:
<P>There is no warning, no comeback, no safety net.
<P>You have been warned.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.21">13.21 dbshow (0)</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE><B>dbshow &lt;dbname&gt; &lt;key&gt;</B> Display an entry, if it exists, in a database</CODE>
<P>
<P>This is the generic user interface to the database to the database system.
It is expected that the sysop will add an entry to the local Aliases file
so that users can use the more familiar AK1A style of enquiry such as:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  SH/BUCK G1TLH
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>but if he hasn't and the database really does exist (use DBAVAIL or
SHOW/COMMAND to find out) you can do the same thing with:

<H2><A NAME="ss13.22">13.22 debug (9)</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE><B>debug</B> Set the cluster program into debug mode</CODE>
<P>
<P>Executing this command will only have an effect if you are running the cluster
in debug mode i.e.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        perl -d cluster.pl
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It will interrupt the cluster just after the debug command has finished.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.23">13.23 directory (0)</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE><B>directory</B> List messages<BR> <B>directory all</B> List all messages<BR>

<B>directory &lt;from&gt;-&lt;to&gt;</B> List messages &lt;from&gt; message &lt;to&gt; message <BR></CODE>
<P>
<P>List the messages in the messages directory.
<P>If there is a 'p' one space after the message number then it is a 
personal message. If there is a '-' between the message number and the
'p' then this indicates that the message has been read.
<P>You can use shell escape characters such as '*' and '?' in the &lt;call&gt;
fields.
<P>You can combine some of the various directory commands together eg:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   DIR TO G1TLH 5
or 
   DIR SUBJECT IOTA 200-250
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You can abbreviate all the commands to one letter and use ak1a syntax:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   DIR/T G1* 10
   DIR/S QSL 10-100 5

<H2><A NAME="ss13.27">13.27 export (9)</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE><B>export &lt;msgno&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</B> Export a message to a file</CODE>
<P>
<P>Export a message to a file. This command can only be executed on a local
console with a fully privileged user. The file produced will be in a form
ready to be imported back into the cluster by placing it in the import 
directory (/spider/msg/import).
<P>This command cannot overwrite an existing file. This is to provide some 
measure of security. Any files written will owned by the same user as the 
main cluster, otherwise you can put the new files anywhere the cluster can
access. For example:-
<P>EXPORT 2345 /tmp/a
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.28">13.28 export_users (9)</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE><B>export_users [&lt;filename&gt;]</B> Export the users database to ascii</CODE>
<P>
<P>Export the users database to a file in ascii format. If no filename
is given then it will export the file to /spider/data/user_asc.
<P>If the file already exists it will be renamed to &lt;filename&gt;.o. In fact
up to 5 generations of the file can be kept each one with an extra 'o' on the
suffix. 
<P>BE WARNED: this will write to any file you have write access to. No check is
made on the filename (if any) that you specify.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.29">13.29 forward/latlong (8)</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE><B>forward/latlong &lt;node_call&gt;</B> Send latitude and longitude information to another cluster</CODE>
<P>
<P>This command sends all the latitude and longitude information that your
cluster is holding against callsigns.  One advantage of recieving this
information is that more locator information is held by you.  This
means that more locators are given on the DX line assuming you have
<EM>set/dxgrid</EM> enabled.  This could be a LOT of information though, so
it is not recommended on slow links.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.30">13.30 forward/opername (1)</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE><B>forward/opername &lt;call&gt;</B> Send out information on this &lt;call&gt; to all clusters</CODE>
<P>
<P>This command sends out any information held in the user file which can 
be broadcast in PC41 protocol packets. This information is Name, QTH, Location
and Homenode. PC41s are only sent for the information that is available.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.31">13.31 help (0)</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE><B>help &lt;cmd&gt;</B> Get help on a command</CODE>
<P>
<P>All commands can be abbreviated, so SHOW/DX can be abbreviated

<P>
<P>This command attempts to re-initialise a link to a (usually) AK1A node
that has got confused, usually by a protocol loop of some kind. It may
work - but you usually will be better off simply disconnecting it (or
better, if it is a real AK1A node, doing an RCMD &lt;node&gt; DISC/F &lt;your
node&gt;).
<P>Best of luck - you will need it.

<P>From version 1.35 onwards neighbouring nodes are pinged at regular intervals (see

counter which is decremented on every outgoing ping and then reset to
the 'obscount' value on every incoming ping. The default value of this

<P>What this means is that a neighbouring node will be pinged twice at 
(default) 300 second intervals and if no reply has been heard just before
what would be the third attempt, that node is disconnected.

(Zen) and the likely signal strengths. Then for each frequency for which
the system thinks there is a likelihood of a circuit it prints a value.
<P>The value is currently a likely S meter reading based on the conventional
6dB / S point scale. If the value has a '+' appended it means that it is
1/2 an S point stronger. If the value is preceeded by an 'm' it means that
there is likely to be much fading and by an 's' that the signal is likely
to be noisy.  
<P>By default SHOW/MUF will show the next two hours worth of data. You
can specify anything up to 24 hours worth of data by appending the no of
hours required after the prefix. For example:-

your assigned password (see SET/PASSWORD). The indexes start from
zero.
<P>You are expected to return a string which contains the characters
required in the correct order. You may intersperse those characters
with others to obscure your reply for any watchers. For example (and

Send a text message to &lt;callsign&gt; via &lt;node_call&gt;</CODE>
<P>
<P>Send a short message to any other station that is visible on the cluster
system. You can send it to anyone you can see with a SHOW/CONFIGURATION 
command, they don't have to be connected locally.
<P>The second form of TALK is used when other cluster nodes are connected
with restricted information. This usually means that they don't send 
the user information usually associated with logging on and off the cluster.
<P>If you know that G3JNB is likely to be present on GB7TLH, but you can only
see GB7TLH in the SH/C list but with no users, then you would use the
second form of the talk message.
<P>If you want to have a ragchew with someone you can leave the text message
out and the system will go into 'Talk' mode. What this means is that a
short message is sent to the recipient telling them that you are in a 'Talking' 
frame of mind and then you just type - everything you send will go to the 
station that you asked for. 
<P>All the usual announcements, spots and so on will still come out on your
terminal.
<P>If you want to do something (such as send a spot) you precede the normal 
command with a '/' character, eg:-
