<P>In earlier versions of Spider, all the processes were Perl scripts.  This was fine but with a lot of users your computer memory would soon be used up.  To combat this a new client was written in "C".  This client only works for <EM>incoming</EM> connects at the moment.  Before you can use it though it has to be "made".  CD to /spider/src and type <EM>make</EM>.  You should see the output on your screen and hopefully now have a small C program called <EM>client</EM>.  Leave it in this directory.
<P>
