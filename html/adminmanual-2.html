# the list of regexes for messages that we won't store having
# received them (bear in mind that we must receive them fully before
# we can bin them)


# The format of each line is as follows

#     type      source             pattern 
#     P/B/F     T/F/O/S            regex  

# type: P - private, B - bulletin (msg), F - file (ak1a bull)
# source: T - to field, F - from field,  O - origin, S - subject 
# pattern: a perl regex on the field requested

# Currently only type B and P msgs are affected by this code.
# 
# The list is read from the top down, the first pattern that matches
# causes the action to be taken.

# The pattern can be undef or 0 in which case it will always be selected
# for the action specified

<P>I think this is fairly self explanatory.  It is simply a list of subject 
headers that we do not want to pass on to either the users of the cluster or 
the other cluster nodes that we are linked to.  This is usually because of 
rules and regulations pertaining to items for sale etc in a particular country.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2</A> <A HREF="adminmanual.html#toc2.2">Filtering words from text fields in Announce, Talk and DX spots</A>
</H2>

<P>From version 1.48 onwards the interface to this has changed. You can now
use the commands <EM>set/badword</EM> to add words that you are not prepared
to see on the cluster, <EM>unset/badword</EM> to allow that word again and 
<EM>show/badword</EM> to list the words that you have set.</P>

<P>If you have a previous <EM>/spider/data/badwords</EM>, the first time you start
the node, it will read and convert this file to the new commands. The old style
file will then be removed.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3</A> <A HREF="adminmanual.html#toc2.3">Stopping (possibly bad) DX Spots from Nodes or Spotters</A>
</H2>

<P> 
There are a number of commands that control whether a spot progresses
any further by regarding it as "bad" in some way.</P>

<P>A DX Spot has a number of fields which can be checked to see whether they
contain "bad" values, they are: the DX callsign itself, the Spotter and
the Originating Node.</P>

<P>There are a set of commands which allow the sysop to control whether a
spot continues:-</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
set/baddx
set/badspotter
set/badnode
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>These work in the same as the <EM>set/badword</EM> command, you can add
any words or callsigns or whatever to the appropriate database. For
example, to stop a spot from a particular node you do:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
set/badnode gb7djk gb7dxc
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>a bad spotter:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>

</P>
<P>and some bad dx:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
set/baddx video wsjt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You can remove a word using the appropriate unset command
(<EM>unset/baddx, unset/badspotter, unset/badnode</EM>) or list them
using one of <EM>show/baddx, show/badspotter</EM> and
<EM>show/badnode</EM>.</P>
