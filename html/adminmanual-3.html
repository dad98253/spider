<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Mail</A></H2>

<P>DXSpider deals seamlessly with standard AK1A type mail.  It supports both
personal and bulletin mail and the sysop has additional commands to ensure
that mail gets to where it is meant.  DXSpider will send mail almost
immediately, assuming that the target is on line.  However, only one
mail message is dealt with at any one time.  If a mail message is already
being sent or recieved, then the new message will be queued until it has
finished.
<P>The cluster mail is automatically deleted after 30 days unless the sysop
sets the "keep" flag using the <EM>msg</EM> command.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Personal mail</A>
</H2>

<P>Personal mail is sent using the <EM>sp</EM> command.  This is actually the
default method of sending mail and so a simple <EM>s</EM> for send will do.
A full list of the send commands and options is in the <EM>command set</EM>
section, so I will not duplicate them here.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Bulletin mail</A>
</H2>

<P>Bulletin mail is sent by using the <EM>sb</EM> command.  This is one of the
most common mistakes users make when sending mail.  They send a bulletin
mail with <EM>s</EM> or <EM>sp</EM> instead of <EM>sb</EM> and of course
the message never leaves the cluster.  This can be rectified by the sysop
by using the <EM>msg</EM> command.
<P>
<P>Bulletin addresses can be set using the Forward.pl file.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Forward.pl</A>
</H2>

<P>DXSpider receives all and any mail sent to it without any alterations needed
in files.  Because personal and bulletin mail are treated differently, there
is no need for a list of accepted bulletin addresses.  It is necessary, however,
to tell the program which links accept which bulletins.  For example, it is
pointless sending bulletins addresses to "UK" to any links other than UK
ones.  The file that does this is called forward.pl and lives in /spider/msg.
At default, like other spider files it is named forward.pl.issue.  Rename it
to forward.pl and edit the file to match your requirements.
The format is below ...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#
# this is an example message forwarding file for the system
#
# The format of each line is as follows
#
#     type    to/from/at pattern action  destinations
#     P/B/F     T/F/A     regex   I/F    [ call [, call ...] ]
#
# type: P - private, B - bulletin (msg), F - file (ak1a bull)
# to/from/at: T - to field, F - from field, A - home bbs, O - origin 
# pattern: a perl regex on the field requested
# action: I - ignore, F - forward
# destinations: a reference to an array containing node callsigns
#
# if it is non-private and isn't in here then it won't get forwarded 
#
# Currently only type B msgs are affected by this code.
# 
# The list is read from the top down, the first pattern that matches
# causes the action to be taken.
#
# The pattern can be undef or 0 in which case it will always be selected
# for the action specified
#
# If the BBS list is undef or 0 and the action is 'F' (and it matches the
# pattern) then it will always be forwarded to every node that doesn't have 
# it (I strongly recommend you don't use this unless you REALLY mean it, if
# you allow a new link with this on EVERY bull will be forwarded immediately
# on first connection)
#

package DXMsg;

<P>Simply insert a bulletin address and state in the brackets where you wish
that mail to go.  For example, you can see here that mail sent to "UK" will
only be sent to the UK links and not to PA4AB-14.
<P>
<P>To force the cluster to reread the file use load/forward
<P>
<P>NB: If a user tries to send mail to a bulletin address that does not exist
in this file, they will get an error.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 The msg command</A>
</H2>

<P>The <EM>msg</EM> command is a very powerful and flexible tool for the
sysop.  It allows the sysop to alter to and from fields and make other
changes to manage the cluster mail.
<P>Here is a full list of the various options ...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  MSG TO &lt;msgno> &lt;call>     - change TO callsign to &lt;call>
  MSG FRom &lt;msgno> &lt;call>   - change FROM callsign to &lt;call>
  MSG PRrivate &lt;msgno>      - set private flag
  MSG NOPRrivate &lt;msgno>    - unset private flag
  MSG RR &lt;msgno>            - set RR flag
  MSG NORR &lt;msgno>          - unset RR flag
  MSG KEep &lt;msgno>          - set the keep flag (message won't be deleted ever)
  MSG NOKEep &lt;msgno>        - unset the keep flag
  MSG SUbject &lt;msgno> &lt;new> - change the subject to &lt;new>
  MSG WAittime &lt;msgno>      - remove any waiting time for this message
  MSG NOREad &lt;msgno>        - mark message as unread
  MSG REad &lt;msgno>          - mark message as read
  MSG QUeue                 - queue any outstanding bulletins
  MSG QUeue 1               - queue any outstanding private messages

<P>These commands are simply typed from within the cluster as the sysop user.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 Message status</A>
</H2>

<P>You can check on a message from within the cluster by using the command
<EM>stat/msg</EM>.  This will give you additional information on the
message number including which nodes have received it, which node it
was received from and when etc.  Here is an example of the output of
the command ...

<P>This is described in the section on <EM>Other filters</EM> so I will not
duplicate it here.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.7">3.7 Distribution lists</A>
</H2>

<P>Distribution lists are simply a list of users to send certain types of
mail to.  An example of this is mail you only wish to send to other
sysops.  In /spider/msg there is a directory called <EM>distro</EM>.  You
put any distibution lists in here.  For example, here is a file called
SYSOP.pl that caters for the UK sysops.

<P>Any mail sent to "sysop" would only be sent to the callsigns in this list.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.8">3.8 BBS interface</A>
</H2>

<P>Spider provides a simple BBS interface.  No input is required from the sysop
of the cluster at all.  The BBS simply sets the cluster as a BBS and pushes
any required mail to the cluster.  No mail can flow from Spider to the BBS,
the interface is one-way.
<P>
<P>Please be careful not to flood the cluster network with unnecessary mail.
Make sure you only send mail to the clusters that want it by using the
Forward.pl file very carefully.
