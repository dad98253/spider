<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Allowing ax25 connects from users</A>
</H2>

<P>As stated previously, the aim of this document is not to tell you how to 
configure Linux or the ax25 utilities.  However, you do need to add a line 
in your ax25d.conf to allow connections to DXSpider for your users.  For
each interface that you wish to allow connections on, use the following format ...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
default  * * * * * *  - sysop /spider/src/client client %u ax25
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Allowing telnet connects from users</A>
</H2>

<P>Allowing telnet connections is quite simple.  Firstly you need to add a line 
in /etc/services to allow connections to a port number, like this ....
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
spdlogin   8000/tcp     # spider anonymous login port
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Then add a line in /etc/inetd.conf like this ....
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
spdlogin stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /spider/src/client login telnet
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>This needs to be added above the standard services such as ftp, telnet etc.  
Once this is done, you need to restart inetd like this ....
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
killall -HUP inetd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
<P>Now login as <EM>sysop</EM> and cd spider/perl. You can test that spider 
is accepting telnet logins by issuing the following command ....
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
client.pl login telnet
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You should get a login prompt and on issuing a callsign, you will be given 
access to the cluster.  Note, you will not get a password login.  There seems 
no good reason for a password prompt to be given so it is not asked for.
<P>
<P>Assuming all is well, then try a telnet from your linux console ....
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
telnet localhost 8000
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>You should now get the login prompt and be able to login as before.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Setting up node connects</A>
</H2>

<P>In order to allow cluster node connections, spider needs to know that the 
connecting callsign is a cluster node.  This is the case whether the connect 
is incoming or outgoing.  In spider this is a simple task and can be done in 
runtime.
<P>
<P>Later versions of Spider can distinguish different software and treat them
differently.  For example, the WCY beacon cannot be handles by AK1A type
nodes as AK1A does not know what to do with PC73.  There are 4 different
types of node at present and although they may not have any major
differences at the moment, it allows for compatibility.  The 4 types are ...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
set/node        (AK1A type)
set/spider
set/dxnet
set/clx
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>For now, we will assume that the cluster we are going to connect to is an
AK1A type node.
<P>
<P>Start up the cluster as you did before and login as the sysop with client.pl.
The cluster node I am wanting to make a connection to is GB7BAA but you would
obviously use whatever callsign you required.  At the prompt type ...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
set/node gb7baa
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>The case does not matter as long as you have a version of DXSpider later than 
1.33.  Earlier versions required the callsign to be in upper case.
<P>
<P>That is now set, it is as simple as that.  To prove it, login on yet another 
console as sysop and issue the command ...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
client.pl gb7baa (using the callsign you set as a node)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>You should get an initialisation string from DXSpider like this ...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
client.pl gb7baa
PC38^GB7MBC^~
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If the callsign you just set up as a cluster node is for an incoming connect, 
this is all that needs to be done.  If the connection is to be outgoing then 
a connection script needs to be written.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Connection scripts</A>
</H2>

<P>Because DXSpider operates under Linux, connections can be made using just about 
any protocol;  AX25, NETRom, tcp/ip, ROSE etc are all possible examples.  
Connect scripts live in the /spider/connect directory and are simple ascii files.  
Writing a script for connections is therefore relatively simple.  
<P>
<P>The connect scripts consist of lines which start with the following keywords 
or symbols:-
<P>
<PRE>
        
#               All lines starting with a # are ignored, as are completely 
                blank lines.

timeout         timeout followed by a number is the number of seconds to wait for a 
                command to complete. If there is no timeout specified in the script 
                then the default is 60 seconds.

abort           abort is a regular expression containing one or more strings to look 
                for to abort a connection. This is a perl regular expression and is 
                executed ignoring case.

connect         connect followed by ax25 or telnet and some type dependent 
                information. In the case of a telnet connection, there can be up to 
                two parameters.
                The first is the ip address or hostname of the computer you wish to 
                connect to and the second is the port number you want to use (this 
                can be left out if it is a normal telnet session).
                In the case of an ax25 session then this would normally be a call to
                ax25_call or netrom_call as in the example above. It is your
                responsibility to get your node and other ax25 parameters to work 
                before going down this route!

'               ' is the delimiting character for a word or phrase of an expect/send 
                line in a chat type script. The words/phrases normally come in pairs,
                either can be empty. Each line reads input from the connection until 
                it sees the string (or perl regular expression) contained in the
                left hand string. If the left hand string is empty then it doesn't 
                read or wait for anything. The comparison is done ignoring case.
                When the left hand string has found what it is looking for (if it is)
                then the right hand string is sent to the connection.
                This process is repeated for every line of chat script. 

client          client starts the connection, put the arguments you would want here 
                if you were starting the client program manually. You only need this 
                if the script has a different name to the callsign you are trying to 
                connect to (i.e. you have a script called other which actually 
                connects to GB7DJK-1 [instead of a script called gb7djk-1]).
</PRE>
<P>
<P>There are many possible ways to configure the script but here are two examples, 
one for a NETRom/AX25 connect and one for tcp/ip.  
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

You will find other examples in the /spider/examples directory.

<P>
<P>With later versions of Spider there is a set/login command for users.  This 
tells them when a user or node logs in or out.  If you do not add a line to 
your scripts after the final line (or before the client line which should always 
be last if needed) then the login/logout information will be sent to users
<I>before</I> the login actually completes.  This means if a node is 
unreachable, it will continue sending logins and logouts to users even though it 
is not actually connecting.  To avoid this use the following line ...

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.6">3.6 Telnet echo</A>
</H2>

<P>Cluster links in particular suffer greatly from the presence of telnet echo.  
This is caused by the telnet negotiation itself and can create at worst severe 
loops.  At best it creates unnecessary bandwidth and large logfiles!  There are
things that can be done to limit this problem but will not always work dependent 
on the route taken to connect.
<P>
<P>Telnet echo itself should only be a problem if the connection is being made to 
the telnet port (23).  This port uses special rules that include echo negotiation.
If the connection is to a different port, such as 8000, this negotiation does 
not happen and therefore no echo should be present.
<P>
<P>Sometimes it is not possible to make a direct connection to another node and this 
can cause problems.  There is a way of trying to suppress the telnet echo but 
this will not always work, unfortunately it is difficult to be more specific.  
Here is an example of what I mean ...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
timeout 35
abort (Busy|Sorry|Fail)
connect telnet mary.lancs.ac.uk
'ogin:' 'gb7mbc'
'word:' 'mypasswd'
'\$' 'stty -echo raw'
'\$' 'telnet 44.131.93.96'
'connect' ''
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>So, the first connection is made by Spider.  This is fine as Spider uses the
Net_Telnet script from within perl.  This actually uses TCP rather than TELNET 
so no negotiation will be done on the first connection.  Once connected to
mary.lancs.ac.uk, the command is sent to suppress echo.  Now a telnet is made 
to a cluster node that is accepting connections on port 23.  The problem with 
this link is that the negotiation is made by the remote machine, therefore you 
have no control over it.  The chances are that this link will create echo and 
there will be no way you can stop it.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.7">3.7 Automating things</A>
</H2>

<P>Ok, you should now have DXSpider running nicely and allowing connects by cluster
nodes or users.  However, it has to be shutdown and restarted manually and if
connection scripts fail they have to be started again manually too, not much use 
if you are not at the console!  So, in this section we will automate both.  
Firstly starting the cluster.
<P>
<H3>Autostarting the cluster</H3>

<P>This is not only a way to start the cluster automatically, it also works as a
watchdog, checking the sanity of DXSpider and respawning it should it crash for 
any reason.  Before doing the following, shutdown the cluster as you did earlier.
<P>
<P>Login as root and bring up the /etc/inittab file in your favourite editor.  Add 
the following lines to the file near the end ...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
##Start DXSpider on bootup and respawn it should it crash
DX:3:respawn:/bin/su -c "/usr/bin/perl -w /spider/perl/cluster.pl" sysop >/dev/tty7
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>This will automatically start DXSpider on tty7 (ALT-F7) on bootup and restart 
it should it crash for any reason.
<P>
<P>As root type the command <EM>telinit q</EM>.  DXSpider should start up 
immediately.  You will see the output on tty7 and if you login as <EM>sysop</EM> 
you should find everything running nicely.
<P>
<P>So far so good, now to automate script connections...
<P>
<H3>The crontab file</H3>

<P>Login as <EM>sysop</EM> and create a file in /spider/local_cmd called crontab.  
Edit it with your favourite editor and add a line like this (I have included 
a comment)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# check every 10 minutes to see if gb7xxx is connected and if not
# start a connect job going

0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * start_connect('gb7xxx') if !connected('gb7xxx')
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>The callsign involved will be the callsign of the cluster node you are 
going to connect to.  This will now check every 10 minutes to see if 
gb7xxx is connected, if it is then nothing will be done.  If it is not, 
then a connect attempt will be started.
<P>
<P>There are probably lots of other things you could use this crontab file for.  
If you want to know more about it, look at the
<A HREF="http://www.dxcluster.org/cron.html">DXSpider</A> website 
at the cron page where it is explained more fully.
