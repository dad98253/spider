<P>From 1.48 onwards it will become increasingly possible to control DXSpider's
operation with scripts of various kinds.
<P>
<P>In the first instance, in 1.48, the sysop can create, with their favorite 
text editor, files in the directory <EM>/spider/scripts</EM> which contain
any legal command for a callsign or class of connection which will be executed
at logon.
<P>
<P> 
The filename is the callsign of the connection that you want the script to 
operate on, eg: <EM>/spider/scripts/g1tlh</EM>. The filenames are always in 
lower case on those architectures where this makes a difference.
<P>
<P>In addition to the callsign specific scripts there are three others:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
startup
user_default
node_default
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <EM>startup</EM> script is executed immediately after all
initialisation of the node is done, but before any connections are
possible.
<P>
<P>The <EM>user_default</EM> script is executed for every user that does
<B>NOT</B> already have a specific script.
<P>
<P>The <EM>node_default</EM> script is executed for every node that doesn't
have a specific script.
<P>
<P>There are a couple of examples in the <EM>/spider/scripts</EM> directory.
