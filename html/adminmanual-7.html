<H2><A NAME="s7">7. Filtering (New Style v1.45 and later)</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 General filter rules</A>
</H2>

<P>Upto v1.44 it was not possible for the user to set their own filters.  From 
v1.45 though that has all changed.  It is now possible to set filters for just 
about anything you wish.  If you have just updated from an older version of 
DXSpider you will need to update your new filters.  You do not need to do 
anything with your old filters, they will be renamed as you update.
<P>
<P>There are 3 basic commands involved in setting and manipulating filters.  These 
are <EM>accept</EM>, <EM>reject</EM> and <EM>clear</EM>.  First we will look
generally at filtering. There are a number of things you can filter in the 
DXSpider system. They all use the same general mechanism.
<P>
<P>In general terms you can create a 'reject' or an 'accept' filter which can have 
up to 10 lines in it. You do this using, for example ... 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 
accept/spots .....
reject/spots .....
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>where ..... are the specific commands for that type of filter. There are filters 
for spots, wwv, announce, wcy and (for sysops) connects. See each different 
accept or reject command reference for more details.
<P>There is also a command to clear out one or more lines in a filter. They are ...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
clear/spots 1
clear/spots all
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There is clear/xxxx command for each type of filter.
<P>
<P>and you can check that your filters have worked by the command ... 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  
show/filter
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>For now we are going to use spots for the examples, but you can apply the same
principles to all types of filter.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Types of filter</A>
</H2>

<P>There are two main types of filter, <EM>accept</EM> or <EM>reject</EM>.  You 
can use either to achieve the result you want dependent on your own preference 
and which is more simple to do.  It is pointless writing 8 lines of reject 
filters when 1 accept filter would do the same thing!  Each filter has 10 
lines (of any length) which are tried in order.  If a line matches then the 
action you have specified is taken (ie reject means ignore it and accept 
means take it)
<P>
<P>If you specify reject filters, then any lines that arrive that match the filter 
will be dumped but all else will be accepted.  If you use an accept filter, 
then ONLY the lines in the filter will be accepted and all else will be dumped.
For example if you have a single line <EM>accept</EM> filter ...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
accept/spots on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>then you will <EM>ONLY</EM> get VHF spots <EM>from</EM> or <EM>to</EM> CQ zones 
14, 15 and 16.
<P>
<P>If you set a reject filter like this ...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
reject/spots on hf/cw
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Then you will get everything <EM>EXCEPT</EM> HF CW spots.  You could make this 
single filter even more flexible.  For example, if you are interested in IOTA 
and will work it even on CW even though normally you are not interested in 
CW, then you could say ...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
reject/spots on hf/cw and not info iota
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>But in that case you might only be interested in iota and say:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
accept/spots not on hf/cw or info iota
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>which achieves exactly the same thing. You should choose one or the other 
until you are comfortable with the way it works. You can mix them if you 
wish (actually you can have an accept AND a reject on the same line) but 
don't attempt this until you are sure you know what you are doing!
<P>
<P>You can arrange your filter lines into logical units, either for your own
understanding or simply convenience. Here is an example ...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
reject/spots 1 on hf/cw
reject/spots 2 on 50000/1400000 not (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)  
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>What this does is to ignore all HF CW spots and also rejects any spots on VHF 
which don't either originate or spot someone in Europe. 
<P>
<P>This is an example where you would use a line number (1 and 2 in this case), if 
you leave the digit out, the system assumes '1'. Digits '0'-'9' are available.  
This make it easier to see just what filters you have set.  It also makes it 
more simple to remove individual filters, during a contest for example.
<P>
<P>You will notice in the above example that the second line has brackets.  Look 
at the line logically.  You can see there are 2 separate sections to it.  We 
are saying reject spots that are VHF or above <EM>APART</EM> from those in 
zones 14, 15 and 16 (either spotted there or originated there).  If you did 
not have the brackets to separate the 2 sections, then Spider would read it 
logically from the front and see a different expression entirely ...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
(on 50000/1400000 and by_zone 14,15,16) or call_zone 14,15,16 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The simple way to remember this is, if you use OR - use brackets. Whilst we are 
here CASE is not important. 'And BY_Zone' is just the same as 'and by_zone'.
<P>As mentioned earlier, setting several filters can be more flexible than 
simply setting one complex one.  Doing it in this way means that if you want 
to alter your filter you can just redefine or remove one or more lines of it or 
one line. For example ...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
reject/spots 1 on hf/ssb
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>would redefine our earlier example, or 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
clear/spots 1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To remove all the filter lines in the spot filter ...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
clear/spots all
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Filter options</A>
</H2>

<P>You can filter in several different ways.  The options are listed in the
various helpfiles for accept, reject and filter.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 Default filters</A>
</H2>

<P>Sometimes all that is needed is a general rule for node connects.  This can
be done with a node_default filter.  This rule will always be followed, even
if the link is isolated, unless another filter is set specifically.  Default
rules can be set for nodes and users.  They can be set for spots, announces,
WWV and WCY.  They can also be used for hops.  An example might look like 
this ...
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
accept/spot node_default by_zone 14,15,16,20,33
set/hops node_default spot 50
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This filter is for spots only, you could set others for announce, WWV and WCY.
This filter would work for ALL nodes unless a specific filter is written to 
override it for a particular node.  You can also set a user_default should
you require.  It is important to note that default filters should be
considered to be "connected".  By this I mean that should you override the
default filter for spots, you need to add a rule for the hops for spots also.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5 Advanced filtering</A>
</H2>

<P>Once you are happy with the results you get, you may like to experiment. 
<P>
<P>The previous example that filters hf/cw spots and accepts vhf/uhf spots from EU 
can be written with a mixed filter, for example ... 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
rej/spot on hf/cw
acc/spot on 0/30000
acc/spot 2 on 50000/1400000 and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note that the first filter has not been specified with a number.  This will 
automatically be assumed to be number 1.  In this case, we have said <EM>reject all
HF spots in the CW section of the bands but accept all others at HF.  Also
accept anything in VHF and above spotted in or by operators in the zones
14, 15 and 16</EM>.  Each filter slot actually has a 'reject' slot and 
an 'accept' slot. The reject slot is executed BEFORE the accept slot.
<P>
<P>It was mentioned earlier that after a reject test that doesn't match, the default 
for following tests is 'accept', the reverse is true for 'accept'. In the example 
what happens is that the reject is executed first, any non hf/cw spot is passed 
to the accept line, which lets through everything else on HF.  The next filter line 
lets through just VHF/UHF spots from EU.
<P>
