<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1</A> <A HREF="adminmanual_en.html#toc1.1">Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P>From DXSpider version 1.48, major changes were introduced to the way 
node connections are treated.  This is part of an ongoing process to
remove problems with loops and to enable talk and other functions to
propagate across the whole of the worldwide cluster network.  In fact,
in a Spider network, it would be useful, perhaps even necessary to
have loops.  This would give real resilience to the network, meaning
that if a link dropped, the information flow would simply come in and
go out via a different route.  Of course, we do not have a complete
network of Spider nodes, there are other programs out there.  Some of
these do not have any protection from loops.  Certainly AK1A does not 
handle loops well at all.  It is therefore necessary to have some form 
of protection for these nodes.</P>

<P>In fact DXSpider has had a simple system for some time which is called
<I>isolation</I>. This is similar to what in other systems such as 
<B>clx</B>, is called <I>passive mode</I>. A more detailed explanation
of <I>isolation</I> is given further below. This system is still available
and, for simple networks, is probably all that you need.</P>

<P>The new functionality introduced in version 1.48 allows filtering the node
and user protocol frames on a "per interface" basis. We call this
<I>route filtering</I>. This is used <B>instead of</B>
<I>isolation</I>. </P>

<P>What this really means is that you can control more or less completely
which user and node management PC protocol frames pass to each of your 
partner nodes. You can also limit what comes into your node from your 
partners. It is even possible to control the settings that your partner 
node has for the routing information that it sends to you 
(using the <I>rcmd</I> command).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2</A> <A HREF="adminmanual_en.html#toc1.2">Route Filters</A>
</H2>

<P>Initially when route filters were being tested we generated a
"default" filter.  Unfortunately it quickly became apparent that this
might suit the UK cluster network but didn't really fit anybody else.
However using a default filter is an appropriate thing to do. How, is
explained further on.</P>

<P>The first thing that you must do is determine whether you need to use 
route filtering <B>at all</B>. If you are a "normal" node with two or 
three partners and you arranged in an "official" non-looping tree type 
network, then <B>you do not need to do route filtering</B> and you will 
feel a lot better for not getting involved. If you are successfully using 
<I>isolation</I> then you also probably don't need to use route filtering.</P>

<P>To put it simply, you should not mix Isolation and Route Filtering.  It 
will work, of sorts, but you will not get the expected results.  If you 
are using Isolation sucessfully at the moment, do not get involved in 
Route Filtering unless you have a good supply of aspirin!  Once you have 
started down the road of Route Filtering, do not use Isolation either.
Use one or the other, not both.</P>

<P>You will only require this functionality if you are "well-connected". What 
that means is that you are connected to several different parts of (say) 
the EU cluster and, at the same time, also connected to two or three places 
in the US which, in turn are connected back to the EU. This is called a 
"loop" and if you are seriously looped then you need filtering.</P>

<P>I should at this stage give a little bit of background on filters.  All
the filters in Spider work in basically the same way.  You can either
accept or reject various options in order to create the filter rules
you wish to achieve.  Some filters are user settable, others can only
be altered by the sysop.  Route filtering can only be done by the sysop.</P>

<P> 
Anyway, without further discouragement, let me start the process
of explanation.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3</A> <A HREF="adminmanual_en.html#toc1.3">The node_default filter</A>
</H2>

<P>All normal systems should have a default routing filter and it should
usually be set to send only the normal, unlooped, view of your
"national" network.  Here in the UK that means nodes from the UK and
Eire, in EU it is more complex as the networks there grew up in a more
intertwined way.</P>

<P> 
The generic commands are:-</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
reject/route node_default &lt;filter_option&gt;

or

accept/route node_default &lt;filter_option&gt;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>where filter_option is one of the following ...</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
call &lt;prefixes&gt;
call_dxcc &lt;numbers&gt;
call_itu &lt;numbers&gt;
call_zone &lt;numbers&gt;
channel &lt;prefixes&gt;
channel_dxcc &lt;numbers&gt;
channel_itu &lt;numbers&gt;
channel_zone &lt;numbers&gt;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Please be careful if you alter this setting, it will affect 
<B><I>ALL</I></B> your links!  Remember, this is a <I>default</I>
filter for node connections, not a <I>per link</I> default.</P>

<P>For the default routing filter then you have two real choices: either
a "national" view or the "safe" option of only your own
callsign. Examples of each (for my node: GB7DJK) are:-</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
acc/route node_default call_dxcc 61,38
acc/route node_default call gb7djk
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>GB7DJK uses the first of these. The DXCC countries can be obtained from the 
<I>show/prefix</I> command.</P>

<P>The example filters shown control <I>output</I> <B>TO</B> all your
partner nodes unless they have a specific filter applied to them (see
next section).</P>

<P>It is also possible to control the <I>incoming</I> routing
information that you are prepared to accept <B>FROM</B> your partner
nodes. The reason this is necessary is to make sure that stuff like
mail, pings and similar commands a) go down the correct links and b)
don't loop around excessively. Again using GB7DJK as an example a typical
default input filter would be something like:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
rej/route node_default input call_dxcc 61,38 and not channel_dxcc 61,38
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>What this does is accept node and user information for our national
network from nodes that are in our national network, but rejects such
information from anyone else. Although it doesn't explicitly say so,
by implication, any other node information (not from the UK and Eire)
is accepted.</P>

<P>As I imagine it will take a little while to get one's head around all of 
this you can study the effect of any rules that you try by watching the 
debug output after having done:-</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
set/debug filter
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>After you have got tired of that, to put it back the way it was:-</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
unset/debug filter

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4</A> <A HREF="adminmanual_en.html#toc1.4">General route filtering</A>
</H2>

<P>Exactly the same rules apply for general route filtering.  You would
use either an accept filter or a reject filter like this ...</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
reject/route &lt;node_call&gt; &lt;filter_option&gt;

or

accept/route &lt;node_call&gt; &lt;filter_option&gt; 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>Here are some examples of route filters ...</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
rej/route gb7djk call_dxcc 61,38 (send everything except UK+EIRE nodes)
rej/route all                    (equiv to [very] restricted mode)
acc/route gb7djk call_dxcc 61,38 (send only UK+EIRE nodes)
acc/route gb7djk call gb7djk     (equiv to SET/ISOLATE)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>In practice you will either be opening the default filter out for a
partner by defining a specific filter for that callsign:-</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
acc/route gb7baa all
acc/route gb7baa input all
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>or restricting it quite a lot, in fact making it very nearly like an 
<I>isolated</I> node, like this:-</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
acc/route pi4ehv-8 call gb7djk
rej/route pi4ehv-8 input call_dxcc 61,38 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This last example takes everything except UK and Eire from PI4EHV-8
but only sends him my local configuration (just a PC19 for GB7DJK and
PC16s for my local users).</P>

<P>It is possible to write <B>much</B> more complex rules, there are up 
to 10 accept/reject pairs per callsign per filter. For more information 
see the next section. </P>


<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5</A> <A HREF="adminmanual_en.html#toc1.5">General filter rules</A>
</H2>

<P>Upto v1.44 it was not possible for the user to set their own filters.  From 
v1.45 though that has all changed.  It is now possible to set filters for just 
about anything you wish.  If you have just updated from an older version of 
DXSpider you will need to update your new filters.  You do not need to do 
anything with your old filters, they will be renamed as you update.</P>

<P>There are 3 basic commands involved in setting and manipulating filters.  These 
are <EM>accept</EM>, <EM>reject</EM> and <EM>clear</EM>.  First we will look
generally at filtering. There are a number of things you can filter in the 
DXSpider system. They all use the same general mechanism.</P>

<P>In general terms you can create a "reject" or an "accept" filter which can have 
up to 10 lines in it. You do this using, for example ... </P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 
accept/spots .....
reject/spots .....
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>where ..... are the specific commands for that type of filter. There are filters 
for spots, wwv, announce, wcy and (for sysops) connects. See each different 
accept or reject command reference for more details.</P>
<P>There is also a command to clear out one or more lines in a filter. They are ...</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
clear/spots 1
clear/spots all
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>There is clear/xxxx command for each type of filter.</P>

<P>and you can check that your filters have worked by the command ... </P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  
show/filter
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>For now we are going to use spots for the examples, but you can apply the same
principles to all types of filter.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.6">1.6</A> <A HREF="adminmanual_en.html#toc1.6">Types of filter</A>
</H2>

<P>There are two main types of filter, <EM>accept</EM> or <EM>reject</EM>.  You 
can use either to achieve the result you want dependent on your own preference 
and which is more simple to do.  It is pointless writing 8 lines of reject 
filters when 1 accept filter would do the same thing!  Each filter has 10 
lines (of any length) which are tried in order.  If a line matches then the 
action you have specified is taken (ie reject means ignore it and accept 
means take it)</P>

<P>If you specify reject filters, then any lines that arrive that match the filter 
will be dumped but all else will be accepted.  If you use an accept filter, 
then ONLY the lines in the filter will be accepted and all else will be dumped.
For example if you have a single line <EM>accept</EM> filter ...</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
accept/spots on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>then you will <EM>ONLY</EM> get VHF spots <EM>from</EM> or <EM>to</EM> CQ zones 
14, 15 and 16.</P>

<P>If you set a reject filter like this ...</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
reject/spots on hf/cw
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Then you will get everything <EM>EXCEPT</EM> HF CW spots.  You could make this 
single filter even more flexible.  For example, if you are interested in IOTA 
and will work it even on CW even though normally you are not interested in 
CW, then you could say ...</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
reject/spots on hf/cw and not info iota
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>But in that case you might only be interested in iota and say:-</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
accept/spots not on hf/cw or info iota
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>which achieves exactly the same thing. You should choose one or the other 
until you are comfortable with the way it works. You can mix them if you 
wish (actually you can have an accept AND a reject on the same line) but 
don't attempt this until you are sure you know what you are doing!</P>

<P>You can arrange your filter lines into logical units, either for your own
understanding or simply convenience. Here is an example ...</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
reject/spots 1 on hf/cw
reject/spots 2 on 50000/1400000 not (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)  
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>What this does is to ignore all HF CW spots and also rejects any spots on VHF 
which don't either originate or spot someone in Europe. </P>

<P>This is an example where you would use a line number (1 and 2 in this case), if 
you leave the digit out, the system assumes '1'. Digits '0'-'9' are available.  
This make it easier to see just what filters you have set.  It also makes it 
more simple to remove individual filters, during a contest for example.</P>

<P>You will notice in the above example that the second line has brackets.  Look 
at the line logically.  You can see there are 2 separate sections to it.  We 
are saying reject spots that are VHF or above <EM>APART</EM> from those in 
zones 14, 15 and 16 (either spotted there or originated there).  If you did 
not have the brackets to separate the 2 sections, then Spider would read it 
logically from the front and see a different expression entirely ...</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
(on 50000/1400000 and by_zone 14,15,16) or call_zone 14,15,16 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The simple way to remember this is, if you use OR - use brackets. Whilst we are 
here CASE is not important. 'And BY_Zone' is just the same as 'and by_zone'.</P>
<P>As mentioned earlier, setting several filters can be more flexible than 
simply setting one complex one.  Doing it in this way means that if you want 
to alter your filter you can just redefine or remove one or more lines of it or 
one line. For example ...</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
reject/spots 1 on hf/ssb

</P>
<P>would redefine our earlier example, or </P>
<P>

</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.7">1.7</A> <A HREF="adminmanual_en.html#toc1.7">Filter options</A>
</H2>

<P>You can filter in several different ways.  The options are listed in the
various helpfiles for accept, reject and filter.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.8">1.8</A> <A HREF="adminmanual_en.html#toc1.8">Default filters</A>
</H2>

<P>Sometimes all that is needed is a general rule for node connects.  This can
be done with a node_default filter.  This rule will always be followed, even
if the link is isolated, unless another filter is set specifically.  Default
rules can be set for nodes and users.  They can be set for spots, announces,
WWV and WCY.  They can also be used for hops.  An example might look like 
this ...</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
accept/spot node_default by_zone 14,15,16,20,33
set/hops node_default spot 50
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This filter is for spots only, you could set others for announce, WWV and WCY.
This filter would work for ALL nodes unless a specific filter is written to 
override it for a particular node.  You can also set a user_default should
you require.  It is important to note that default filters should be
considered to be "connected".  By this I mean that should you override the
default filter for spots, you need to add a rule for the hops for spots also.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.9">1.9</A> <A HREF="adminmanual_en.html#toc1.9">Advanced filtering</A>
</H2>

<P>Once you are happy with the results you get, you may like to experiment. </P>

<P>The previous example that filters hf/cw spots and accepts vhf/uhf spots from EU 
can be written with a mixed filter, for example ... </P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
rej/spot on hf/cw
acc/spot on 0/30000
acc/spot 2 on 50000/1400000 and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Note that the first filter has not been specified with a number.  This will 
automatically be assumed to be number 1.  In this case, we have said <EM>reject all
HF spots in the CW section of the bands but accept all others at HF.  Also
accept anything in VHF and above spotted in or by operators in the zones
14, 15 and 16</EM>.  Each filter slot actually has a 'reject' slot and 
an 'accept' slot. The reject slot is executed BEFORE the accept slot.</P>

<P>It was mentioned earlier that after a reject test that doesn't match, the default 
for following tests is 'accept', the reverse is true for 'accept'. In the example 
what happens is that the reject is executed first, any non hf/cw spot is passed 
to the accept line, which lets through everything else on HF.  The next filter line 
lets through just VHF/UHF spots from EU.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.10">1.10</A> <A HREF="adminmanual_en.html#toc1.10">Basic hop control</A>
</H2>

<P>In /spider/data you will find a file called hop_table.pl.  This is the file 
that controls your hop count settings.  It has a set of default hops on the 
various PC frames and also a set for each node you want to alter the hops for.  
You may be happy with the default settings of course, but this powerful tool 
can help to protect and improve the network.  The file will look something 
like this ...</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.12">1.12</A> <A HREF="adminmanual_en.html#toc1.12">Isolating networks</A>
</H2>

<P>It is possible to isolate networks from each other on a "gateway" node using the
<EM>set/isolate &lt;node_call&gt;</EM> command.</P>

<P>The effect of this is to partition an isolated network completely from another 
node connected to your node. Your node will appear on and otherwise behave 
normally on every network to which you are connected, but data from an isolated 
network will not cross onto any other network or vice versa. However all the 
spot, announce and WWV traffic and personal messages will still be handled 
locally (because you are a real node on all connected networks), that is locally
connected users will appear on all networks and will be able to access and 
receive information from all networks transparently.  All routed messages will 
be sent as normal, so if a user on one network knows that you are a gateway for 
another network, he can still still send a talk/announce etc message via your 
node and it will be routed across.</P>

<P>If you use isolate on a node connection you will continue to receive
all information from the isolated partner, however you will not pass
any information back to the isolated node.  There are times when you
would like to forward only spots across a link (maybe during a contest
for example).  To do this, isolate the node in the normal way and use
an <EM>acc/spot &gt;call&lt; all</EM> filter to override the isolate. </P>
