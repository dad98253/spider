<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1</A> <A HREF="adminmanual_en.html#toc6.1">MOTD</A>
</H2>

<P>One of the more important things a cluster sysop needs to do is to get 
information to his users.  The simplest way to do this is to have a banner 
that is sent to the user on login.  This is know as a "message of the day" 
or "motd".  To set this up, simply create a file in /spider/data called motd 
and edit it to say whatever you want.  It is purely a text file and will be 
sent automatically to anyone logging in to the cluster.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2</A> <A HREF="adminmanual_en.html#toc6.2">MOTD_NOR</A>
</H2>

<P>This message of the day file lives in the same directory as the standard
motd file but is only sent to non-registered users.  Once registered they
will receive the same message as any other user.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3</A> <A HREF="adminmanual_en.html#toc6.3">Downtime message</A>
</H2>

<P>If for any reason the cluster is down, maybe for upgrade or maintenance but 
the machine is still running, a message can be sent to the user advising them 
of the fact.  This message lives in the /spider/data directory and is called
"offline".  Simply create the file and edit it to say whatever you wish.  
This file will be sent to a user attempting to log into the cluster when
DXSpider is not actually running.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4</A> <A HREF="adminmanual_en.html#toc6.4">Other text messages</A>
</H2>

<P>You can set other text messages to be read by the user if they input the file 
name.  This could be for news items or maybe information for new users.  
To set this up, make a directory under /spider called <EM>packclus</EM>.  
Under this directory you can create files called <EM>news</EM> or <EM>newuser</EM>
for example.  In fact you can create files with any names you like.  These can 
be listed by the user with the command ....</P>

<P>They can be read by the user by typing the command ....</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

type news

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If the file they want to read is called <EM>news</EM>.  You could also set 
an alias for this in the Alias file to allow them just to type <EM>news</EM></P>

<P>You can also store other information in this directory, either directly or 
nested under directories.  One use for this would be to store DX bulletins 
such as the OPDX bulletins.  These can be listed and read by the user.  
To keep things tidy, make a directory under /spider/packclus called
<EM>bulletin</EM>.  Now copy any OPDX or similar bulletins into it.  These 
can be listed by the user in the same way as above using the <EM>show/files</EM>
command with an extension for the bulletin directory you have just created, 
like this ....</P>

<P>You can see that in the files area (basically the packclus directory) there is a 
file called <EM>news</EM> and a directory called <EM>bulletin</EM>.  You can 
also see that dates they were created.  In the case of the file <EM>news</EM>, 
you can also see the time it was last modified, a good clue as to whether the 
file has been updated since you last read it.  To read the file called 
<EM>news</EM> you would simply issue the command ....</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5</A> <A HREF="adminmanual_en.html#toc6.5">The Aliases file</A>
</H2>

<P>You will find a file in /spider/cmd/ called Aliases.  This is the file that
controls what a user gets when issuing a command.  It is also possible to
create your own aliases for databases and files you create locally.</P>

<P>You should not alter the original file in /spider/cmd/ but create a new file
with the same name in /spider/local_cmd.  This means that any new Aliases files
that is downloaded will not overwrite your self created Aliases and also that
you do not override any new Aliases with your copy in /spider/local_cmd/.  You
must remember that any files you store in /spider/local/ or /spider/local_cmd
override the originals if the same lines are used in both files.</P>

<P>The best way of dealing with all this then is to only put your own locally
created Aliases in the copy in /spider/local_cmd.  The example below is
currently in use at GB7MBC.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>

#
# Local Aliases File

package CmdAlias;

%alias = (
    'n' => [
      '^news$', 'type news', 'type',
    ],
    's' => [
      '^sh\w*/buck$', 'show/qrz', 'show',
      '^sh\w*/hftest$', 'dbshow hftest', 'dbshow',
      '^sh\w*/qsl$', 'dbshow qsl', 'dbshow',
      '^sh\w*/vhf$', 'dbshow vhf', 'dbshow',
      '^sh\w*/vhftest$', 'dbshow vhftest', 'dbshow',
        ],
)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>Each alphabetical section should be preceded by the initial letter and the section
should be wrapped in square brackets as you can see.  The syntax is straightforward.
The first section on each line is the new command that will be allowed once the
alias is included.  The second section is the command it is replacing and the last
section is the actual command that is being used.</P>

<P>The eagle-eyed amongst you will have noticed that in the first section, the new
alias command has a '^' at the start and a '$' at the end.  Basically these force
a perfect match on the alias.  The '^' says match the beginning exactly and the
'$' says match the end exactly.  This prevents unwanted and unintentional matches
with similar commands.</P>

<P>I have 3 different types of alias in this file.  At the top is an alias for 'news'.  
This is a file I have created in the /spider/packclus/ directory where I can inform 
users of new developments or points of interest.  In it's initial form a user would 
have to use the command <EM>type news</EM>.  The alias allows them to simply type 
<EM>news</EM> to get the info.  Second is an alias for the <EM>show/qrz</EM>
command so that those users used to the original <EM>show/buck</EM> command in
AK1A will not get an error, and the rest of the lines are for locally created
databases so that a user can type <EM>show/hftest</EM> instead of having to use
the command <EM>dbshow hftest</EM> which is not as intuitive.</P>

<P>This file is just an example and you should edit it to your own requirements.
Once created, simply issue the command <EM>load/alias</EM> at the cluster
prompt as the sysop user and the aliases should be available.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss6.6">6.6</A> <A HREF="adminmanual_en.html#toc6.6">Console.pl</A>
</H2>

<P>In later versions of Spider a simple console program is provided for the sysop.  
This has a type ahead buffer with line editing facilities and colour for spots,
announces etc.  To use this program, simply use console.pl instead of client.</P>

<P>To edit the colours, copy /spider/perl/Console.pl to /spider/local and edit the 
file with your favourite editor.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.7">6.7</A> <A HREF="adminmanual_en.html#toc6.7">Updating kepler data</A>
</H2>

<P>Spider has a powerful and flexible show/satellite command.  In order for
this to be accurate, the kepler data has to be updated regularly.  In
general, this data is available as an email or via cluster mail.
Updating it is simple.  First you need to export the mail message as a
file.  You do this with the <EM>export</EM> command from the cluster prompt
as the sysop.  For example ...</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
export 5467 /spider/perl/keps.in
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>would export message number 5467 as a file called keps.in in the
/spider/perl directory.</P>

<P>Now login to a VT as sysop and cd /spider/perl.  There is a command in
the perl directory called <EM>convkeps.pl</EM>.  All we need to do now is
convert the file like so ...</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
./convkeps.pl keps.in
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>Now go back to the cluster and issue the command ...</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
load/keps
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>That is it!  the kepler data has been updated.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.8">6.8</A> <A HREF="adminmanual_en.html#toc6.8">The QRZ callbook</A>
</H2>

<P>The command <EM>sh/qrz</EM> will only work once you have followed a few
simple steps.  First you need to get a user ID and password from qrz.com.
Simply go to the site and create one.  Secondly you need to copy the file
/spider/perl/Internet.pm to /spider/local and alter it to match your user
ID and password.  You also at this point need to set $allow=1 to complete
the setup.  Many thanks to Fred Lloyd, the proprieter of
<A HREF="http://www.qrz.com">qrz.com</A> for allowing this access.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.9">6.9</A> <A HREF="adminmanual_en.html#toc6.9">Connecting logging programs</A>
</H2>

<P>There appear to be very few logging programs out there that support telnet
especially the popular ones like LogEQF, Turbolog etc.  This can make it
difficult to connect to your own cluster!
The way to do it is to make the logging program think it has a TNC attached
to a com port on the logging PC and 'push' a linux login out to it.
This is achieved very simply by the use of <EM>agetty</EM>.</P>

<P>All that is required is to add a line in /etc/inittab to have the client
ready for a connection on the com port of your choice.  Remember that in
Linux, the com ports start at ttyS0 for com1, ttyS1 for com2 etc.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
c4:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty -L 9600 ttyS1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>Add this after the standard runlevel lines in /etc/inittab.  The above
line works on ttyS1 (com2).  Now as root, issue the command <EM>telinit q</EM>
and it should be ready for connection.  All that is required is a 3 wire
serial lead (tx, rx and signal ground).  Tell you logging program to use
8n1 at 9600 baud and you should see a Linux login prompt.  Login as normal
and then telnet from there to the cluster.</P>
