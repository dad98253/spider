	<h4>Introduction</h4>

	The standard client program is written in perl and lives in <tt>/spider/perl/client.pl</tt>.
	It performs the interface function
	between the cluster daemon (<tt>/spider/perl/cluster.pl</tt>) and 
	AX25 or Telnet connections, both incoming and outgoing.
	
	<p>There is a related program called <tt>/spider/perl/console.pl</tt> which,
	as of version 1.30, is the standard sysop or full duplex telnet user
	connected interface program. This is a simple screen oriented program
	that has a bash or shell like command history editing facility as well
	as a scrolling cluster window with colouration of particular lines of
	interest (such as DX spots, Announces etc).


	<h4>client.pl</h4>

	The client itself is a rather rudimentary program which really only deals with 
	things like line end conventions and noticing when a connection goes away. It is
	envisaged that at some time in the nearish future this program will be written in
	C and thus become considerably smaller. But, for the moment and whilst this area
	is under some development, it will remain in perl for ease of change.

	<P>The client can take up two arguments: a "callsign" and a connection type. 

	<p>The "callsign" can have the following values:-
	<ol>
		<p><li>A real callsign (!).

		<P>For incoming connections it is important to make sure that
		the callsign passed <b>DOES NOT</b> have an SSID (use the %u
		or %U in <tt>ax25d.conf</tt>). The DXSpider system largely
		ignores what it regards as 'duplicate' callsigns (and that
		includes those with SSIDs) except in certain <a
		href="#special">special</a> cases. 

		<P><li>The name of a <a href="connect.html">connect</a> script.

		<p><li><b>login</b> This will cause a unix like <tt>login:</tt> and
		<tt>password:</tt> phase to be run. With version 1.13 the password isn't
		checked unless there is a password recorded in the user file - but you have
		no means of recording a password! (unless you have created a local <tt>set/password</tt>
		command - please donate a copy it you have)
		
		<p>Also in 1.13 only existing users can enter via this means. This will probably
		  change, but please discuss this in the <a href="../lists/dxspider-support/index.html">support</a>
		  mailing list.

	</ol>

	<p>The connection type can be:-
	<ol>
		<p><li><b>ax25</b> This tells the client to use ax25 line conventions.

		<p><li><b>telnet</b> This tells the client to use normal unix line conventions.

		<p><li><b>connect</b> Start an outgoing <a href="connect.html">connect</a> script.
		Use the line conventions in that script.
	</ol>

	<p>The connection type can be missing in which case the default is unix line conventions.

	<p>If both the callsign and the connection are missing then it is
	assumed that the client is the sysop and uses the callsign set in
	your local copy of <a href="install.html#dxvar">DXVars.pm</a>.

	<h4>Considerations</h4>

	<a name="special"></a>As mentioned earlier, SSIDs are generally stripped from
	  callsigns except in two cases:
	<ol>
		<p><li>For Cluster node callsigns. Although here in the UK we are issued with
		special callsigns to run cluster nodes and BBSs, this is not universal. Therefore
		by marking a callsign as a node you disable SSID checking. You will have to treat
		incoming cluster callsigns specially in <tt>ax25d.conf</tt> to use this feature (i.e
		you will have to set up a line specially for that callsign with a %s or %S for the
		callsign substitution [better just put the callsign you want!]).

		<p><li>The sysop callsign set up in your local copy of 
		<a href="install.html#dxvar">DXVars.pm</a>. You must call <tt>client.pl</tt> with
		no parameters for this to work.
	</ol>

	<h4>Files</h4>

	The client only uses files when in the <b>login</b> phase.  It
	prints the <tt>/spider/data/issue</tt> file, if it is present, to
	the user before issuing the <tt>login:</tt> prompt. After a callsign
	and password is entered it uses
	the standard cluster user file to check them.

	<p>Having said all of that the client <em>appears</em> to use the following files and
	  sends them to the user if they are present:-
	<ul>
	  <li><b>/spider/data/issue</b> which is sent before a login prompt.
	  <li><b>/spider/data/connect</b> which is sent immediately after a successful login.
	  <li><b>/spider/data/motd</b> which is sent to the user on normal user startup.
	  <li><b>/spider/data/logout</b> which is sent to user on disconnection.
	  <li><b>/spider/data/offline</b> which is sent to the user if the cluster daemon 
		isn't running.
	</ul>
