	<p>At the moment, anybody can connect inwards at any time from outside, either by ax25 or by
	  telnet (assuming you have followed the instructions in <a href="install.html">installation</a>
	  instructions. However, in order to connect outwards, you will need to create <em>connect</em> scripts.
	  
	<p><em>Connect</em> scripts live in the <tt>/spider/connect</tt> directory and are simple ascii scripts
	  that are written using a normal editor. There are a couple of examples in the issue directory.

	<p>The first example is a simple telnet (TCP/IP) connect to port 7000 of WR3D (this will actually
	  work if you have or make an arrangement to connect to WR3D)[oh, and substitute x1xxx for your real
	  node callsign].</p>

	<p>The colouration will be explained later on in this page, you don't have to try to emulate the colours!</p>

	<pre>
    <span class=cmd>timeout 15</span>
    # this is a comment
    <span class=connect>connect telnet wr3d.dxcluster.net 7000</span>
    <span class=expect>'login'</span> <span class=send>'x1xxx'</span>
    <span class=cmd>client wr3d telnet</span>
	</pre>

	<p>If you put the above script in a file called: <tt>/spider/connect/wr3d</tt> then you can leave out 
	  line: <span class=cmd>client wr3d telnet</span>.
	<p>For a connect that requires a login and execution of the programs
	  from a normal shell, do:-</p>

	<pre>
    <span class=cmd>timeout 15</span>
    <span class=connect>connect telnet dirkl.tobit.co.uk</span>
    <span class=expect>'login'</span> <span class=send>'gb7djk'</span>
    <span class=expect>'word'</span> <span class=send>'gb7djk'</span>
    <span class=expect>'\$'</span> <span class=send>'cd /spider/perl'</span>
    # set the line to prevent echoing, leaving this out will
    # confuse whole networks for hours!
    <span class=expect>'\$'</span> <span class=send>'stty -echo raw'</span>
    # tell GB7DJK that you are GB7DJK-1
    <span class=expect>'\$'</span> <span class=send>'/spider/src/client gb7djk-1 telnet'</span>
    # tell GB7DJK-1 that it is connected to GB7DJK
    # you can leave this out if you call this script 'gb7djk'
    <span class=cmd>client gb7djk telnet</span>
	</pre>

	<p>An ax25 example (connecting from GB7DJK, to GB7DXM via my local BPQ node and one X1J intermediate node):-

	<pre>
    <span class=cmd>timeout 60</span>
    <span class=cmd>abort (Busy|Sorry|Fail)</span>
    # don't forget to chmod 4775 netrom_call!
    <span class=connect>connect ax25 /usr/sbin/netrom_call bbs gb7djk-0 g1tlh-0</span>
    <span class=expect>'Connected'</span> <span class=send>'c np7'</span>
    <span class=expect>'*** Connect'</span> <span class=send>'c gb7dxm'</span>
    <span class=expect>'Connect'</span> <span class=send>''</span>
	</pre>

    <p>The <tt>-0</tt> ssid is important if you want it to work reliably. Obviously if you are
    using a different ssid then you would use that. You can use the Netrom alias instead if it
	it is in the machines node table.</p>

	<p>The line: "<tt><span class=expect>'Connected'</span> <span class=send>''</span></tt>" means: wait for
	  the string <span class=expect>Connected</span> and when that is seen, then move onto the next line
	  <b>without <span class=send>sending</span> anything</b>. The reason you do this (in this case) is to wait
	for the final "connect" string from the BPQ node that directly connects you to the
	cluster node itself.</p>

    <p>An AGW Engine example would be very similar and look like this:-</p>

	<pre>
    <span class=cmd>timeout 60</span>
    <span class=cmd>abort (Busy|Sorry|Fail)</span>
    <span class=connect>connect agw 2 g1tlh</span>
    <span class=expect>'*** Connect'</span> <span class=send>'c np7'</span>
    <span class=expect>'Connected'</span> <span class=send>'c gb7dxm'</span>
    <span class=expect>'Connect'</span> <span class=send>''</span>
	</pre>
	
	<p>A connection is started manually by typing in <tt>connect &lt;scriptname&gt;</tt> on a sysop enabled
	  <tt>client.pl</tt> session. For example:-</p>

	<pre>
    G1TLH de GB7DJK 13-Dec-1998 2041Z > connect gb7djk-1
    connection to GB7DJK-1 started
    G1TLH de GB7DJK 13-Dec-1998 2043Z > 
	</pre>
	
	<p>Consider the following specific example, it is located in the file <tt>/spider/connect/gb7djk-1</tt> :-</p>

    <pre>
    <span class=cmd>timeout 15</span>
    <span class=connect>connect telnet dirkl.tobit.co.uk</span>
    <span class=expect>'login'</span> <span class=send>'gb7djk'</span>
    <span class=expect>'ssword'</span> <span class=send>'gb7djk'</span>
    </pre>

    <p>You can watch the progress of the connection (if you have <tt>connect</tt> 
     debugging enabled [<tt>set/debug connect</tt>]) on the
	  <tt>cluster.pl</tt> screen and you should see something like this:-</p>

	<pre>
    &lt;- D G1TLH connect gb7djk-1
    -> D G1TLH connection to GB7DJK-1 started
    -> D G1TLH G1TLH de GB7DJK 13-Dec-1998 2046Z >
    <span class=cmd>timeout set to 15</span>
    <span class=connect>CONNECT sort: telnet command: dirkl.tobit.co.uk</span>

	<p>I have coloured the commands in an attempt to make it clear as
	to what goes on, where and why.  Lines that are <span
	class=cmd>coloured thus</span> are miscellaneous setup
	commands. Lines that are <span class=connect>this colour</span>
	are lines that make the initial <span
	class=connect>connection</span> to the first hop. The things that
	are <span class=expect>this colour</span> are the strings I am
	looking for (what I am <span class=expect>"expecting"</span>) and
	the things that are <span class=send>this colour</span> are the
	commands I am going to <span class=send>send</span> when I see the
	"expect" strings in the input.</p>

	<p>The script starts by setting the timeout to 15 seconds, then starts
	  the connection. It is <b>important</b> to note that, in the case of 
	  an ax25 connection (usually) this will be the callsign of the <i>first hop</i> along the 
	  route that you are going to take to the destination, so this will be typically the callsign
	  of your local node.</p>

    <p>You will notice that the script <span class=expect>waits</span>
    until it sees the left hand string of the pair and <b>only
    then</b> does it <span class=send>send</span> the string on the
    right hand side. This is called a <i>State Machine</i>.</p>

	<p>A <i>state machine</i> "walks" through a conversation (in this
	case) looking for "<span class=expect>states</span>" (in this case
	particular strings) and then performs some "<span
	class=send>action</span>" (usually some kind of connect command
	for the type of system you are trying to navigate). When one
	"<span class=expect>state</span>" "fires"
	(detects the string are looking for), it <span class=send>sends the command</span>
	associated with that state and then moves onto the next "<span
	class=expect>state</span>", in our case: the next line.</p>

	<p><b>PLEASE NOTE</b>: the colouration in the above example is for illustrative purposes
	  only, the debug output is all one colour.</p>

	<p>The connect scripts consist of lines which start with the
	following keywords or symbols:-</p>

	<ul>

		<li><b>#</b> All lines starting with a <b>#</b> are
		ignored, as are wholly blank lines.
        <br><br>

		<li><b><span class=cmd>timeout</span></b> followed by a number is the number of
		seconds to wait for a command to complete. If there is no
		<b><span class=cmd>timeout</span></b> specified in the script then the default is 60
		seconds.
        <br><br>

		<li><b><span class=cmd>abort</span></b> is a regular expression containing one or
		more strings to look for to abort a connection. This is a perl
		regular expression and is executed ignoring case.
        <br><br>

		<li><b><span class=connect>connect</span></b> followed by <b>ax25</b>, <b>telnet</b> or <b>agw</b>
		and some type dependent information. 

        <p>In the case of a
		<b>telnet</b> connection, there can be up to two parameters,
		the first is the ip address or hostname of the computer you
		wish to connect to and the second is the port number you want
		to use (this can be left out if it is a normal telnet
		session).</p>

		<p>In the case of an <b>ax25</b> session then this would
		normally be a call to <tt>/usr/sbin/ax25_call</tt> or
		<tt>/usr/sbin/netrom_call</tt> as in the example above. It is your
		responsibility to get your node and other ax25 parameters to
		work before going down this route!</p>

        <p>For <b>agw</b> connections you will need a port number (starting
        from 1) and the callsign of the first &quot;hop&quot; along the way.</p>

		<li><b>'</b> is the delimiting character for a word or phrase
		of an <span class=expect>expect</span>/<span
		class=send>send</span> line.  The words/phrases normally come
		in pairs, but either can be empty. Each line reads input from
		the connection until it sees the string (or perl regular
		expression) that 
		is contained in the left hand string. 

		<p>When the <span class=expect>left hand string</span> has found what it is <span class=expect>expecting</span> (if
		it is) then the <span class=send>right hand string</span> is <span class=send>sent</span> to the connection.</p>

		<p>If the <span class=expect>left hand
		string</span> is empty then it doesn't read or wait for anything, it
		simply <span class=send>sends</span> whatever is on the <span class=send>right hand side</span>.</p> 

		<p>All comparisons are done ignoring case.</p>

		<p>If the <span class=send>right hand string</span> is empty ('') then nothing is <span class=send>sent</span>, the 
		  script simply moves onto the next line.</P>

		<p>This process is repeated for every line of <tt>chat</tt> script.</p> 

		<li><b><span class=cmd>client</span></b> starts the connection, put the arguments
		you would want here if you were starting the client program
		manually. You only need this if the script has a different
		name to the callsign you are trying to connect to (i.e. you
		have a script called <tt>other</tt> which actually connects to
		<tt>GB7DJK-1</tt> [instead of a script called
		<tt>gb7djk-1</tt>]).
