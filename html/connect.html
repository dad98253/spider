	<p>At the moment, anybody can connect inwards at any time from outside, either by ax25 or by
	  telnet (assuming you have followed the instructions in <a href="install.html">installation</a>
	  instructions. However, in order to connect outwards, you will need to create <em>connect</em> scripts.
	  
	<p><em>Connect</em> scripts live in the <tt>/spider/connect</tt> directory and are simple ascii scripts
	  that are written using a normal editor. There are a couple of examples in the issue directory.
	  
	<p>Here are a couple of basic types, first a telnet connection:-
	<pre>
    timeout 15
    # this is a comment
    connect telnet dirkl.tobit.co.uk
    'login' 'gb7djk'
    'word' 'gb7djk'
    client gb7djk-1 telnet
	</pre>
	<p>and an ax25 example:-
	<pre>
    timeout 60
    abort (Busy|Sorry|Fail)
    # don't forget to chmod 4775 netrom_call!
    connect ax25 /usr/sbin/netrom_call bbs gb7djk g1tlh
    'Connect' ''
    'Connect' 'c np7'
    'Connect' 'c gb7dxm'
    'Connect' ''
    client gb7dxm ax25
	</pre>
	
	<p>A connection is started manually by typing in <tt>connect <scriptname></tt> on a sysop enabled
	  <tt>client.pl</tt> session. For example:-
	<pre>
    G1TLH de GB7DJK 13-Dec-1998 2041Z > connect gb7djk-1
    connection to GB7DJK-1 started
    G1TLH de GB7DJK 13-Dec-1998 2043Z > 
	</pre>
	
    <p>You can watch the progress of the connection (if you have the standard debugging enabled) on the
	  <tt>cluster.pl</tt> screen and you should see something like this:-
	<pre>
    &lt;- D G1TLH connect gb7djk-1
    -> D G1TLH connection to GB7DJK-1 started
    -> D G1TLH G1TLH de GB7DJK 13-Dec-1998 2046Z >
    timeout set to 15
    CONNECT sort: telnet command: dirkl.tobit.co.uk
    CHAT "login" -> "gb7djk"
    received "
    Red Hat Linux release 5.1 (Manhattan)
    Kernel 2.0.35 on an i586
    "
    received "login: "
    sent "gb7djk"
    CHAT "word" -> "gb7djk"
    received "gb7djk
 
    "
    received "Password: "
    sent "gb7djk"
    Connected to GB7DJK-1, starting normal protocol
    &lt;- O GB7DJK-1 telnet
    -> B GB7DJK-1 0
    GB7DJK-1 channel func  state 0 -> init
    &lt;- D GB7DJK-1 
    &lt;- D GB7DJK-1 Last login: Sun Dec 13 17:59:56 from dirk1
    &lt;- D GB7DJK-1 PC38^GB7DJK-1^~
    &lt;- D GB7DJK-1 PC18^ 1 nodes, 0 local / 1 total users  Max users 0  Uptime 0 00:00^5447^~
    etc
	</pre>
	
	<p>The connect scripts consist of lines which start with the following keywords or symbols:-
	<ul>
		<p><li><b>#</b> All lines starting with a <b>#</b> are ignored, as are wholly blank lines.
		<p><li><b>timeout</b> followed by a number is the number of seconds to wait for a command
		to complete. If there is no <b>timeout</b> specified in the script then the default is 60 seconds.
		<P><li><b>abort</b> is a regular expression containing one or more strings to look for to abort a 
		connection. This is a perl regular expression and is executed ignoring case.
		<p><li><b>connect</b> followed by <b>ax25</b> or <b>telnet</b> and some type dependent information. In 
		the case of a <b>telnet</b> connection, there can be up to two parameters, the first is the ip
		address or hostname of the computer you wish to connect to and the second is the port number you
		want to use (this can be left out if it is a normal telnet session).
		<p>In the case of an <b>ax25</b> session then this would normally be a call to <tt>ax25_call</tt>
		  or <tt>netrom_call</tt> as in the example above. It is your responsibility to get your node
		  and other ax25 parameters to work before going down this route!
		<p><li><b>'</b> or <b>"</b> are the delimiting characters for a <tt>chat</tt> type script. They normally
		come in pairs, either can be empty. Each line reads input from the connection until it sees the string
		(or perl regular expression) contained in the left hand string. If the  left hand string is empty then
		it doesn't read or wait for anything. The comparison is done ignoring case.
		<p>When the left hand string has found what it is looking (if it is) then the right hand string is
		  sent to the connection. 
		<p>This process is repeated for every line of <tt>chat</tt> script. 
		<p><li><b>client</b> starts the connection, put the arguments you would want here if you were
		starting the client program manually. You only need this if the script has a different name to
		the callsign you are trying to connect to (i.e. you have a script called <tt>other</tt> which actually
		connects to <tt>GB7DJK-1</tt> [instead of a script called <tt>gb7djk-1</tt>]).
