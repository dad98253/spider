	<h4>Introduction</h4>

	There are a number of jobs that need to be done periodically. The
	principle one being starting <a
	href="connect.html">connections</a> to other clusters if you are
	not connected. The <tt>crontab</tt> allows you to do this.

	<h4>Location</h4>

	There two locations for the <tt>crontab</tt> files. The first and standard one (which
	in common with other 'issue' files should not be changed) lives at <b>/spider/cmd/crontab</b>.
	The sysop changable one lives at <b>/spider/local_cmd/crontab</b>.

	<p>The files will automatically be re-read whenever you change them.

	<h4>The <tt>Crontab</tt> File </h4>

	The <tt>crontab</tt> file defines what is to be done and
	when. It consists of lines of text created by your favorite editor. Completely blank
	lines or lines starting with '#' are ignored.

	<p>Each line of a <tt>crontab</tt> file contains six fields
	each separated with white space. The first five fields are times when the
	command is to be executed and the last field is the command
	itself. The time fields consist of:-

	<p><table border=2>
	  <tr><td>field</td><td>Allowed Values</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>minute</td><td>0 - 59</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>hour</td><td>0 - 23</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>day of month</td><td>1 - 31</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>month</td><td>1 - 12</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>day of week</td><td>0 - 6 (0 is Sunday)</td></tr>
	</table>

	<p>A field may be '*', which means 'any when' for that field.

    <p>Ranges of numbers are allowed.  Ranges are two numbers
    separated with a hyphen.  The specified range is inclusive.  For
    example, 8-11 for an <tt>hours</tt> entry specifies execution at hours
    8, 9, 10 and 11.

    <p>Lists are allowed.  A list is a set of numbers (or ranges)
    separated by commas.  Examples: <tt>1,2,5,9</tt> or <tt>0-3,5,8-12</tt>.

	<p>Commands are actually small snippets of perl. They can be anything legal within
	  perl and the context of the DXSpider <tt>cluster.pl</tt> daemon. The normal use will be connecting
	  to another cluster and a set of routines are specially provided in the context
	  of the <tt>DXCron</tt> package to make this easy. For example
	<pre>
  start_connect('gb7tlh') if !connected('gb7tlh')
    </pre>
	will attempt to start a <a href="connect.html">connection</a>  process to GB7TLH if it isn't
	already locally connected.

	<p>There is absolutely no reason why you could not do something more complicated using information
	  contained inside the DXSpider daemon, but this will obviously require a more complex line of code. 
	  You can also write your own functions, include them within the DXSpider system and call them from
	  the <tt>crontab</tt>

	<p>A full <tt>crontab</tt> file could like like:-
	<pre>
  #
  # This is a sample crontab file 
  #
  #
  # check every 10 minutes to see if gb7tlh is connected and if not
  # start a connect job going

  0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * start_connect('gb7tlh') if !connected('gb7tlh')

  # at 03:15 on Sundays start a job called 'analyse.pl' which does something
  # or other. This starts a new process and runs to completion, be careful
  # what you do with stdin and stdout as they are the same as those of
  # cluster.pl 

  15 3 * * 0 spawn('/spider/local/analyse.pl')

  # this is a pointless command which will echo the string shown
  # on the same terminal as the cluster.pl program after substituting
  # the values for mycall and version
 
  15,30 * * * spawn("echo $main::mycall is a DXSpider Version $main::version DX Cluster system")
	</pre>

	It is important remember that these <tt>crontab</tt> routines execute in line with the main
	cluster code, so if you create a long, slow <tt>crontab</tt> commands, it will impact on the speed
	and usability of the cluster as a whole.

	<h4>Standard Routines</h4>

	As mentioned earlier, there are a small number of routines that are declared in <tt>DXCron</tt>
	context. They are there basically to make the starting of connections and external programs easy.
	They are:-

	<ul>
		<p><li><b>connected(&lt;callsign>)</b> - returns true if the &lt;callsign> is directly connected
		to this cluster node.
		<p><li><b>start_connect(&lt;script-name>)</b> - starts a <a href="connect.html">connection</a>
		script just as if you had typed in <tt>connect script-name</tt> on the sysop console client.
		<p><li><b>spawn(&lt;command>)</b> - start a &lt;command> as a new process. This is used to do
		various batch jobs that you may wish to happen at certain times of the day or week that operate
		on your machine but don't require access to the real-time internals of the cluster daemon. You can
		execute just about any command you like, but <em>be warned</em> <b>stdin</b> and <b>stdout</b> are
		still connected to the same terminal (if any) as the cluster daemon. Any unix command and arguments
		can used, see <tt>exec</tt> in the <a href="http://www.perl.com">perl</a> documentation.
	</ul>

	<h4>Caveats</h4>
	
	There seems to be an intermittent problem when running
	(especially?) with the debugger on. Essentially you will
	experience random crashes with nonsensical error messages. I
	believe that this is caused by stack tracing trying to work inside
	<tt>forked</tt> processes.
