<P>While attempting to learn how DXSpider filters work, I found that I had to glean
bits and pieces of information from the DXSpider User Manual and Administrators 
Guide as well as various posted messages, help files and the program and 
data-base files themselves. Therefore, this is by no means an original work. I 
have used and in some cases copied from some of these sources. What I have tried
to accomplish is to gather this scattered information, put it in one spot 
(please pardon the pun) so others might benefit. I would advise those with 
interest to go back and read these other sources at their leisure.</P>
