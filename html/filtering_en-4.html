Reject filters - any spots that match will be dumped, all others passed on.
Accept filters - any spots that match are passed on, all others are dumped.
Clear filters  - the filter slot(s) referenced will be cleared from the filter 
                 repository

</P>
<P>For the most part we will use only reject and accept filters. These are the main
filter types. Basically, reject means dump it and accept means take it and pass 
it on to the user. By nature, accept filters are more powerful than reject 
filters. A user can generally do with a one line accept rule what it could take 
many lines of reject rules to accomplish. However, the flip-side of this 
statement is that a series of reject filters are usually easier to administer 
and change.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1</A> <A HREF="filtering_en.html#toc4.1">Numbering lines and slots </A>
</H2>

<P>There are ten usable filter slots in DXSpider. Each slot holds one reject and 
one accept rule. Therefore, each type filter can have up to ten lines of rules 
contained in these ten slots. The filter rules must be numbered sequentially, 
that is, 0-9 lines of reject filter rules and 0-9 lines of accept filter rules 
to correspond to their respective slot position. If no number is used, every 
line is assumed to be in slot 1 and the addition of a second filter line of the 
same type without a number will just over-write the first that was previously 
written to slot 1. (Why not slot 0? I don't know. This is the way it works.)</P>

<P><EM>Important:</EM> The filter rules are applied in sequence, i.e., 0-9. If a 
line matches, action is taken on that line. The filter sequence acts on rules 
in the order listed.  It acts on the reject filter in each slot before acting 
on the accept filter contained in that slot. If the slot is completely blank or 
if a reject or accept filter line is missing in that slot it skips right over 
to the next filter rule in the sequence. A picture of a filter set might look 
like this ...</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2</A> <A HREF="filtering_en.html#toc4.2">Reject before accept</A>
</H2>

<P>This is not a good rule for life, but it makes sense for DXSpider filters. As 
a general rule, reject filter rules within a slot are always executed before 
accept filter rules.  There is a very good reason for this.  If a spot doesn't 
match a reject filter, the spot is passed to the next filter line in the set.  
However, if a spot matches an accept filter, it is sent immediately to the user.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3</A> <A HREF="filtering_en.html#toc4.3">Using Multiple Reject Filter Rules</A>
</H2>

<P>Another important concept to know is that you can do everything you want to do 
with multiple reject filters AND NO ACCEPT FILTERS.  By default, if a spot 
doesn't match any of the reject filter definitions, then the system considers 
you want the spot and sends it to you.  For example, the following two filters 
perform exactly the same thing ...</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
accept/spots on contesthf
reject/spots not on contesthf
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>So, why would we choose one rather than the other?  Using reject syntax allows 
you to add another filter line easily, without disturbing the first line.  A 
real example will show us how this works.  Let's say that there is a RTTY 
contest coming up and you don't wish to see the RTTY spots.  Simply add another 
reject filter like this ...</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
reject/spots 2 on hf/rtty
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Note that we need to specify that this is the second line of reject filter 
definitions.  Also, the "RTTY" sub-band specification has to be associated with 
a range of bands; it can't be specified all by itself.  So, we just add it 
behind the range of bands defined by "HF".  So in our example, if the user does 
a show/filter, he will be told by the Spider that his current filters are ...</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
filter 1 reject not on contesthf
filter 2 reject on hf/rtty
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>With these filters set up, if a spot comes through on 14085 kHz, the filter 
works like this ...</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
filter1:    Is spot NOT on the HF contest bands?  No.  
            The spot doesn't match the filter definition, so pass it to 
            next filter.

filter2:    Is spot within the frequency range defined for RTTY?  Yes.  
            Since the spot matches the filter definition, the spot is rejected 
            and the user never sees it.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Had the frequency of the spot been 14025, then the spot would have not matched 
the filter2 definition either, would have passed through all the filters, and 
would have been sent to the user at the end of the filter set.  Similarly, had 
the spot been on 10 MHz, it would have met the definition of filter1, been 
rejected immediately, and the filtering process would have stopped before 
processing 
filter2.</P>

<P>In addition, the filtering system has a rough time handling accept filters 
followed by reject filters and adds inefficiency to the processing. 
(Note: a reject as a "qualifier" to an accept rule in an accept filter line is 
okay as we will see below)</P>
