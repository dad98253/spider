<P>An accept filter line means that if a spot matches pass it on to the user, send 
it down the line to the next rule or to the user, and trash, dump, all other 
spots that do not match to the next filter line. </P>

<P>Important: as noted before, both <EM>freq</EM> and <EM>on</EM> are exactly 
the same and can be used interchangeably.</P>

<P>For range, you can specify a frequency like 7040, a range of frequencies 
like 0/30000 ( the whole HF spectrum) or use any of the band/region names 
defined in the SHOW/BANDS command (see above).</P>

<P>Examples...</P>

<P>This will pass on a HF spots only from 0 to 30,000 kHz and dump all others.</P>

<P>In conjunction with range, you can use the following sub-band names: CW, RTTY, 
DATA, SSB, and SSTV by using a back-slash [(band or region)/sub-band] as part 
of the range definition. </P>

</P>
<P>This filter is used to key on information contained in the information section 
of the spot. One could use this to accept any spots containing IOTA, QSL OP or 
any other "key-word" used in the information string of the spot. </P>
