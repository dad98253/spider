<P>The proceeding sections have discussed the basics of DXSpider filters. The 
following are some examples utilizing basic filters and some not so basic 
combination filters.</P>

<P>Let's say you don't want to see any of those 6m, 2m, or 220 spots.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
reject/spot 0 on uhf
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>As a good stand alone contest filter ...</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
accept/spot on contesthf/&lt;mode> where mode is either CW, SSB, or RTTY
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Note: since a slot number is not included slot 1 is assumed.</P>

<P>It's a CW contest weekend so you don't want to see any WARC band or SSB spots.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
accept/spots 0 on contesthf/cw
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>It's the same weekend, but you also don't want to see any US or Canadian spots, 
or any rtty and data spots that are included in the CW portion of the bands. 
Any of the following will accomplish the same result:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
reject/spot 0  not on contesthf/cw
reject/spot 1 on contesthf/data
reject/spot 2 call_dxcc w,ve

or

accept/spot 0 on contesthf/cw and not (call_dxcc 226,197 or on contesthf/data)

or

accept/spot 0 on contesthf/cw and not (call_dxcc w,ve or on contesthf/data)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The following two discussions are from the Administrator Manual and are good 
"textbook" examples: </P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
rej/spot on hf/cw
acc/spot on 0/30000
acc/spot 2 on 50000/1400000 and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Note that accept and reject can be abbreviated. Also, the first filter has not 
been specified with a number. This will automatically be assumed to be number 1.
In this case, we have said to reject all HF spots in the CW section of the bands
but accept all others at HF. Also accept anything in VHF and above that is 
spotted in or by operators in the zones 14, 15 and 16. Each filter slot actually
has a 'reject' rule slot and an 'accept' rule slot. The reject rule slot is 
executed BEFORE the accept rule slot. </P>

<P>It was mentioned earlier that after a reject test that doesn't match, the 
default for following tests is 'accept', the reverse is true for 'accept'. In 
the example what happens is that the reject is executed first, any non hf/cw 
spot is passed to the accept line, which lets through everything else on HF. 
The next filter line lets through just VHF/UHF spots from EU. </P>

<P>If you set a reject filter like this ... </P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
reject/spots on hf/cw
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Then you will get everything except HF CW spots. You could make this single 
filter even more flexible. For example, if you are interested in IOTA and will 
work it on CW even though normally you are not interested in CW, then you could 
say ...</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
reject/spots on hf/cw and not info iota
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>But in that case you might only be interested in iota and say,</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
accept/spots not on hf/cw or info iota
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>which achieves exactly the same thing.  Note that since slot numbers were 
not used, slot 1 is assumed.</P>
