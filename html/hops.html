	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	
	Starting with version 1.13 there is simple hop control available on a per
	node basis. Also it is possible to isolate a network completely so that you 
	get all the benefits of being on that network, but can't pass on information
	from it to
	to any other networks you may be connected to (or vice versa).
	
	<h4>Basic Hop Control</h4>

	The number of hops that are set for all PC protocol messages (that require them)
	are specified in <tt>/spider/perl/DXProtVars.pm</tt>. 

	<p>In versions prior to 1.13 you would move this file to
	<tt>/spider/local/</tt> and modify the perl variables:
	<tt>$def_hopcount</tt> and <tt>%hopcount</tt> to some reasonable
	values.

	<p>From version 1.13 onwards a new mechanism has been introduced
	which uses a file called <tt>/spider/data/hop_table.pl</tt>. The
	prefered way of doing basic hop control is now to create this file
	and modify it as you wish. Eventually this file will contain all
	the hop control and related information. An example of the
	<tt>hop_table.pl</tt> file can be found in the
	<tt>/spider/examples</tt> directory.

	<p>You can change this file at any time, including when the
	cluster is running. If you do this then the changes only take
	effect after you have run the <tt>load/hops</tt> command on a
	client console with full sysop privileges.

	<h4>Per Node Hop Control</h4>

	From version 1.13 it is possible to control the number of hops to each
	node. This is done by adding information to the <tt>%nodehops</tt> perl
	variable in the <tt>hop_table.pl</tt> file (as described above). This
	variable is a perl "hash of hashes", which means that you create an 
	entry for every callsign you wish to control and then one line for
	every PC protocol message that you wish to alter. 

	<p>You can also have a entry called <tt>default</tt> for every callsign 
	  so you can set the hops as a whole for all PC messages to just that
	  callsign. This is overridden by any specific hop counts you may have.

	<h4>Example <tt>hop_table.pl</tt> File</h4>

	An example for you:-

	<p><pre>
#
# hop table construction
#

package DXProt;

# default hopcount to use
$def_hopcount = 15;

# some variable hop counts based on message type
%hopcount =
(
    11 => 10,
    16 => 10,
    17 => 10,
    19 => 10,
    21 => 10,
);

#
# the per node hop control thingy
#
 
%nodehops =
(
    GB7DJK-1 => 
    {
         11 => 5,
         16 => 23,
         17 => 23,
         default => 50,
    },

    GB7TLH => 
    {
         19 => 45,
         21 => 45,
         16 => 45,
         17 => 45,
         default => 15, 
    },
);                              
	</pre>

	<p>The figures chosen are not necessarily what I use. What I would say is that
	  until you are certain that you know what you are doing (and that the software
	  is working at least as well as advertised) you should keep the default hop 
	  counts down to the sort of levels shown above.
 
	<h4><a name="isolate"></a>Isolated Networks</h4>

	It is possible to isolate networks from each other on a "gateway" node using
	the <tt>set/isolate &lt;node call></tt> command.
	
	<p>The effect of this is to partition an isolated network
	completely from another nodes connected to your node. Your node
	will appear on and otherwise behave normally on every network to
	which you are connected, but data from isolated network will not
	cross onto any other network or vice versa.

	<P>However all the spot, announce and WWV traffic and personal
	messages will still be handled locally (because you are a real
	node on all connected networks), that is locally connected users
	will appear on all networks and will be able to access and receive
	information from all networks transparently.

	<p>All routed messages will be sent as normal, so if a user on one
	  network knows that you are a gateway for another network, he can still
	  still send a talk/announce etc message via your node and it will 
	  be routed across.

	<p>The only limitation currently is that non-private messages
	cannot be passed down isolated links regardless of whether they
	are generated locally. This will change when the bulletin routing
	facility is added.
