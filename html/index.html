	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	
	The DXSpider DX cluster system is written in <a
	href="http://www.perl.com">perl 5.004</a> running under <a
	href="http://www.linuxhq.com">Linux</a> as an exercise in
	self-training for both protocol research and teaching myself <a
	href="http://www.perl.com">perl</a>.

	<h4>What is a DX Cluster?</h4>

	A DX Cluster is a means for Amateur (Ham) Radio operators to tell each
	other, in realtime, about DX stations (other interesting or rare
	Amateur Radio stations all over the world).

	<p>To quote what is probably the most comprenhsive  source of DX Cluster related 
	  information, the <a href="http://www.cestro.com/pcluster/">DX PacketCluster WebNet</a>, 
	  a Cluster is:-

     <p><em>One station is set up with PacketCluster and is linked to one or
      more other stations who have installed the software. These nodes
      when connected are called a cluster. Clusters are connected to
      clusters, expanding the network. Individual users connect to the
      nodes on a frequency different from what the node stations are
      linked on. Users are capable of announcing DX spots and related
      announcements, send personal talk messages, send and receive
      mail messages, search and retrive archived data, and access data
      from information databases among its many features.</em>

	<p>It's a rather specialised (and not as robust) form of IRC really.

	<p>The original package runs under DOS and was created by Dick Newell AK1A
	  but is no longer under active development. Most replacements also run under
	  DOS and/or are closed source. I wanted something in open source (so I don't
	  have to do <em>all</em> the work) and for Linux.

 	<p>This document will contain all the instructions for its
	installation and use - eventually...
