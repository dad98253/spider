<P>At this point you will need to create 2 additional directories under 
"C:\Spider."  Make directories "C:\spider\local" and "C:\spider\local_cmd". 
If "C:\spider" is missing, go back and figure out why, because it shouldn't be.</P>
<P>Now create your own local copy of the DXVars.pm file by:-</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
copy c:\spider\perl\DXVars.pm.issue
c:\spider\local\DXVars.pm
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Now you'll need to edit this file using a text editor like Notepad. If nothing
else, you can simply</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cd \spider\local
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>and then</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
notepad DXVars.pm
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>to bring up an editor window containing the file. As an absolute
minimum you must adjust the following items in DXVars.pm:-</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> $mycall  - Should hold the callsign of your DX Cluster</LI>
<LI> $myname  - The SysOp's first name</LI>
<LI> $myalias - the SysOp's callsign. Cannot be the same as $mycall!</LI>
<LI> $myqth - The station's geographical location (QTH).</LI>
<LI> $mylatitude - The station latitude in degrees and decimal fractions</LI>
<LI> $mylongitude - The station longitude in degrees and decimal fractions</LI>
<LI> $mylocator - The Maidenhead (or QRA) locator of the station </LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>You really also ought to update the $myqth and $myemail variables. And
unless you are absolutely certain you know what you're doing, you
should change nothing else in this file. Note that if you use an "@" or 
a "$" character in one of the above strings (typically in $myemail) you must 
write them as "\@" or "\$". </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1</A> <A HREF="installation.html#toc6.1">Incoming telnets</A>
</H2>

<P>If you want to enable inbound "TELNET" connections (or you are running
Windows 98, NT, 2000 or XP), you've got a little more work to do. From a
handy "DOS box" that's not doing anything else, do the following:-</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
copy \spider\perl\Listeners.pm \spider\local
cd \spider\local
notepad listeners.pm
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The following line need attention:-</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
#               ["0.0.0.0", 7300],
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>On my machine, I've simply uncommented the "0.0.0.0" entry by
removing the '#' from the front of the line. </P>
<P><B>You MUST carry out this step if you are
running on a Windows 98, NT, 2000 or XP based system</B></P>
<P>If you don't have a static hostname for your machine, and you
intend to allow folk to connect to your machine across the
internet, then I'd suggest you pay a visit to www.dyndns.org and
create one for yourself. While it's free, it will take a modest
amount of effort on your part to read, understand and
implement what needs to be done to set this up.</P>

<P>If your machine is connected to the internet <B>and</B> you don't
want to allow your machine to be visible to the outside world you
should change the "0.0.0.0" to "127.0.0.1" [which is
"localhost"]. This will then only allow connections from inside your
machine. As was said earlier: if you aren't running Win9x (or you want
to use DXTelnet or somesuch), then you need to have the machine
listening at least to "127.0.0.1" ("0.0.0.0" means <B>all</B> IP
addresses).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2</A> <A HREF="installation.html#toc6.2">The AGW packet engine</A>
</H2>

<P>On the assumption that you'll be using the SV2AGW Packet Engine
to interface your radios to the cluster, it would be a good idea to
download the Packet Engine software!  You can get this software from:</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.raag.org/sv2agw/agwpe.zip">http://www.raag.org/sv2agw/agwpe.zip</A></P>
<P>Depending upon your TNCs, you may also need to get:</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.raag.org/sv2agw/drivers.zip">http://www.raag.org/sv2agw/drivers.zip</A></P>
<P>A couple of the tools:</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.raag.org/sv2agw/agwterm.zip">http://www.raag.org/sv2agw/agwterm.zip</A></P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.raag.org/sv2agw/agwmonitor.zip">http://www.raag.org/sv2agw/agwmonitor.zip</A></P>
<P>will also help with troubleshooting of the RF links themselves.</P>
<P>Install and configure AGWPE.  You should now create your own local copy of 
AGWConnect.pm by:-</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
copy c:\spider\perl\AGWConnect.pm
c:\spider\local\AGWConnect.pm
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>and then</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
notepad AGWConnect.pm
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>to bring up an editor window containing the file. You must
consider adjusting the following items in AGWConnect.pm:-</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>$enable - set to '1' to enable AGWPE interface </LI>
<LI>$login  - the login ID you chose when you set up the SV2AGW security :-)</LI>
<LI>$passwd - password that matches $login</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The login ID and passwd only need to be set if you are accessing AGW separately
via its web interface.  This interface is normally not needed for use with DXSpider.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3</A> <A HREF="installation.html#toc6.3">Setting up the initial user files</A>
</H2>

<P>Next you need to create the initial user files, etc. A tool is
supplied which will do this for you. To run the tool:-</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cd \spider\perl
perl create_sysop.pl
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If all goes according to plan, you will see no output from this
program, and after a brief wait, your DOS prompt will be
returned.</P>
<P>Depending on how brave you are, you might now care to try the
following:-</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
perl cluster.pl
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you did everything you were told, your DOS window will now
hold a display which looks something like:-</P>

<P>Now, if that's what you've got, you are very nearly home and dry
(in as far as these particular experiments are concerned, anyhow)</P>
<P>If you are running Windows 9x you can access your new cluster (from
the local machine) by finding yourself another "DOS box" and doing the
following:-</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cd \spider\perl
perl winclient.pl
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you are running Windows NT, 2000 or XP then winclient.pl does not
work. We don't know why other than this seems to be some kind of
incomaptibility in perl. You can achieve the same thing by telnetting
to the port you defined in Listeners.pm (7300 as default), thus:-</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Menu->Start->Run
telnet localhost 7300
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>On getting the <B>login:</B> prompt, enter your sysop callsign (the one you
put in DXVars.pm as $myalias).</P>

<P>I would recommend <B>strongly</B> that you obtain a better telnet
client than that which comes with windows (I use 
<A HREF="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuTTY</A>). </P>

<P>Anyway, if you are rewarded with a display which looks something like:-</P>

Hello Iain, this is GB7SJP in Amersham, Bucks running DXSpider V1.50
Cluster: 1 nodes, 1 local / 1 total users Max users 2 Uptime 0 00:00
M0ADI de GB7SJP 4-Mar-2001 1511Z >
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You've arrived. Try some commands, and see how they feel. (In
case you were wondering, "Iain", "M0ADI" and "GB7SJP" all came
from the version of DXVars.pm that was on the machine when I
started the winclient.pl)</P>

<P>The interface is very basic. It is a simple command line. There are
better looking interfaces. Most of the "standard" logging and DX
Cluster access programs that are capable of connecting via a TCP or
telnet connection will work as a "Sysop Console" client. You connect
to "localhost" on the port that you defined in Listeners.pm (usually
7300). I recommend packages like 
<A HREF="http://www.qsl.net/wd4ngb/telnet.htm">DXTelnet</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4</A> <A HREF="installation.html#toc6.4">Connecting to other clusters</A>
</H2>

<P>If you want to connect this to another cluster, then you'll want to
negotiate a link with someone. For experimental purposes, I'm happy to
allow folk to connect to GB7DXA (spud.ath.cx), on the understanding
that the system may or may not be there and may or may not be
connected to anything particularly useful at any given moment. Contact
me by 
<A HREF="mailto:g0rdi@blacksheep.org">Email</A> if you
want me to set up a connection for you.</P>
