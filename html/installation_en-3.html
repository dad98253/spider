<P>The aim of this section is not to fully cover the installation
and configuration of all the possible ax25 modules.  I will
attempt to cover a simple installation and configure 2 serial
ports as if they had TNC's on them.  I will also show what
additional configuration the DXSpider program requires.</P>

<P>Please bear in mind that I am basing this section on a RedHat
7.1 distribution, if you are using SuSe or any other distibution
then your mileage may vary.  I will be happy to make any changes
and additions if you email me any errors or distribution specific
requirements.</P>

<P>You would probably benefit from reading the 
<A HREF="http://www.fokus.gmd.de/linux/HOWTO/html_single/AX25-HOWTO.html#AEN151">AX25-HOWTO</A> which is much more
comprehensive and an interesting configuration program is also available
called 
<A HREF="http://1409.org/projects/index.html">ax25-config</A> which
may help you to configure things.</P>

<P>The following files are extracts from the working files at GB7MBC and
are in daily use.  However, there are many ways that you can configure the
ax25 utils, this is just the one I use, it does not mean it is necessarily
the best or for that matter, the right way!</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="installation_en.html#toc3.1">Getting Started</A>
</H2>

<P>There are 2 things you need to do initially.  You need to get the
3 files required for the ax25 installation and you need to make
some changes to the kernel configuration.</P>

<P>The first thing is to get the versions of the ax25 utils that match
your kernel.  You may also wish to get a node package of some kind.
There are 2 main node packages in use of which I shall keep to the
original by Tomi Manninen, OH2BNS as this is included in the ax25
rpms as standard.  The other is 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/ham/packet/linux/awznode/">AWZNode</A> by IZ5AWZ.</P>

<P>NB: The AX25 stuff in 2.4 kernels appears to have been broken until 2.4.18.  I
strongly suggest you get at least this kernel.</P>

<P>For 2.4 kernels you need these files...</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2</A> <A HREF="installation_en.html#toc3.2">The kernel</A>
</H2>

<P>First you need to add Amateur Radio Support to your kernel.  This is
a main menu item and should be easily found.  Within this header you
will find lots of options.  For our purposes you need to enable
Amateur Radio AX.25 Level 2 Protocol, NET/ROM and the Serial Port 
KISS Driver.  For the purposes of this document I will work under the
assumption that you include them in the kernel fully, ie not as modules.
If you need to look at compiling your kernel for ax25 more fully, I would
refer to the excellent 
<A HREF="http://www.fokus.gmd.de/linux/HOWTO/html_single/AX25-HOWTO.html#AEN151">AX25-HOWTO</A></P>

<P>I should say at this stage that NET/ROM is not mandatory.  If you do not use it
simply ignore any instruction concerning it.</P>

<P>Now recompile your kernel in the normal way and reboot your system.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3</A> <A HREF="installation_en.html#toc3.3">Installing the RPM's</A>
</H2>

<P>Now install the RPM's you downloaded, libax25 first, then ax25-tools,
then ax25-apps.</P>

have any use unless you are wanting to use that particular protocol,
Rose or axip for example.</P>

<P>NOTE:- before we start it is important to realise that every interface
requires a different SSID.  You should be able to follow this in the
following examples.</P>

</P>

<P>There are a few things to take note of here.  Firstly, all ax25
sections are wrapped in [ ] and all NET/ROM sections are wrapped in
&lt; &gt;.  Secondly you should be able to see that anyone who forgets to
set their callsign in a TNC and tries to connect with the standard
NOCALL set into their TNC will not connect, the 'L' means 'lockout'.
Lastly and importantly, notice the order of the sections.  They are
all done in interface order.</P>

<P>You should be able to see that the normal line for access to the
cluster is like this ..</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
default  * * * * * *  - sysop /spider/src/client client %u ax25
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>however, if you wish your users to be able to use SSID's on their callsigns ..</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
default  * * * * * *  - sysop /spider/src/client client %s ax25
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>For most purposes this is not desirable. The only time you probably will
need this is when you need to allow other cluster nodes that are using SSID's
in. In this case it would probably be better to use the first example and
then add a specific line for that node like this:</P>

</H2>

<P>For those of you that wish to run the node, you need to set up the
node.conf file.  There are a couple of additional files, node.perms is
very similar to the way ftp permissions are set up in NOS systems and 
node.motd is the message anyone logging into the node will get.
The node.conf file sets all the parameters of the node as you would
expect.  An example is below ...</P>

<P>Ok, now we have all the relevant files configured, the next step is to get
it all running.</P>

<P>The first thing to do is attach the TNC's.  Your TNC's should be in KISS mode

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
kill -HUP 592
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>All should now be operational and you should be able to log into the node by

telnet localhost 3000

<P>If that works, you are just about there.  you should (assuming you have radios connected
