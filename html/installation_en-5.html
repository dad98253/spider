</H2>

<P><B>IMPORTANT:</B> </P>
<P>What you'll be left with once you've followed these instructions
is (hopefully) a working DX Spider v1.50 system that is capable
of accepting or originating "internet" connections, plus inbound
and outbound AX.25 and TCP/IP radio connections.</P>
<P>On the other hand, you may have an enquiring mind, or better yet,
may be looking for a useful way of connecting your current
(perhaps) AK1A cluster "to the internet" via some networking
mechanism (BPQEther, etc) or other. I won't be producing
instructions for the latter case, because I don't have an AK1A to
play with. But someone might ...</P>
<P>Whatever, this document is intended to get you started with DX
Spider in a Microsoft Windows &trade; environment. It's not
intended to teach you anything other than how to perform a
minimum configuration of a DX Spider installation and have it
able to connect across "the internet" to other DX Clusters, while
accepting inbound TELNET and radio connections.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2</A> <A HREF="installation_en.html#toc5.2">The requirements</A>
</H2>

<P>The very first things you're going to need are (in order of
importance):-</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A cup of good, strong tea</LI>
<LI>A supported Windows platform with an internet connection so you can
download the necessary software bits and bobs directly to it. There are other ways, but this is preferable.</LI>
<LI>Another cup of good, strong tea</LI>
<LI>If all goes according to plan, about an hour to spare</LI>
<LI>Plenty of good, strong tea</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3</A> <A HREF="installation_en.html#toc5.3">The system</A>
</H2>

<P>The platform I used to generate these instructions was a
"vanilla" Microsoft Windows Me 4.90.3000 system, with a 700MHz
AMD Athlon processor and 96 Mb memory. I've also personally
verified that it runs on my laptop (Pentium 266MHz, 32 Mb memory,
Windows 98 SE v4.10.2222 A) and a computer that I assembled from
a random pile of junk (AMD K6-2 333MHz, 64 Mb memory, Windows 98
v4.10.1998). As a result, I have reason to believe that what I'm
about to describe will perform equally on any 32-bit MS Windows
environment with 32 Mb of memory.</P>
<P>Because of the changes that have recently been made to the core
"cluster.pl" module and the introduction of a very lightweight
"winclient.pl", I have a sneaking suspicion that this will now
run on any platform that has reasonably complete support for
Perl. Is there someone out there with both an enquiring mind and
(say) a Macintosh, for instance?</P>
<P>Please bear in mind, though, that my instructions relate solely
to how to get this going under a Microsoft Windows environment,
and I have zero intention of trying to make them say otherwise.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4</A> <A HREF="installation_en.html#toc5.4">Perl</A>
</H2>

<P>Install your chosen Perl environment. Unless you have a very good
reason for not doing so, I strongly suggest that you use
ActivePerl v5.6. For my testing &amp; development, I used build 623.
(A recent installation used the newer ActivePerl v5.6.1, build
633 without any noticable difficulty.)  You can get this from:
<A HREF="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/Download.html">http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/Download.html</A></P>
<P>The link takes you to an initial page of System Requirements and
Software Prerequisites.  If you do not have it already installed, 
you can download and install the Windows Installer 2.0 for a Win98
installation.  Be forewarned, you will have to reboot your PC at the
completion of the installer's installation.  </P>
<P>If you already have the installer on your PC, simply click on the 
Next arrow at the bottom of the page.  Two clicks will finally get
you to the actual download page.  The MSI version of Build 633 is 
now 8.6MB in size, so make that a big cup of tea or coffee if you're
on a slow dial-up connection.</P>
<P>During installation, please ensure that you do choose the options
to "Add Perl to the PATH environment variable" and "Create Perl
file extension association"; it will make your life so much
easier. Once the installation is finished, be sure to reboot your
PC. You probably won't be told anywhere else that this needs to
be done now, but it does. Really.</P>
<P>Once you've rebooted, open a "DOS box" (Start > Run > command
might do it, if you can't find it elsewhere) and from wherever it
lands, type PERL -v &lt;ENTER&gt; (it's better if that's a lower-case
'v', because an upper-case 'V' means something else. You should
be rewarded with some interesting information about your Perl
installation. If you're not, you must go back to the beginning
and discover what went wrong and fix it. It's pointless to
proceed unless this simple check is passed. Assuming it did work,
you may now move on.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5</A> <A HREF="installation_en.html#toc5.5">Additional packages</A>
</H2>

<P>Some extensions ("packages") need to be added to the base Perl
distribution, and we'll do this next. If you're using the Perl I
recommended, and don't know any better for yourself, then just
blindly following these instructions will work just fine. If that
didn't describe you, then you're on your own.</P>

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.activestate.com/PPMPackages/zips/6xx-builds-only/">http://www.activestate.com/PPMPackages/zips/6xx-builds-only/</A></P>
<P>and download the following files:-</P>

Net-Telnet.zip

Time-HiRes.zip
DB_File.zip

</P>
<P>If this is a new installation, now would also be a good time to 
install a copy of WinZip on your PC.  Make yourself a convenient 
directory to unpack all of these zip files into (I put mine in 
"D:\ppm>" but "C:\ppm" works just as well.) and do the following 
(the bits you type in are blue ).  You can upzip all of the files into
the same directory.  When prompted, simply overwrite the Readme file 
from each zip package.  Note that where these files land will be 
directly related to where you chose to install your ActivePerl 
(mine, as you can probably guess from what follows, went into "D:\Perl"):-</P>

<P>I'm not going to bother you with exhaustive details of the rest
of them, but suffice it to say you need to:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
ppm install DB_File.ppd
ppm install Net-Telnet.ppd
ppm install TimeDate.ppd
ppm install Time-HiRes.ppd
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If all that seemed to work OK, time to move along. Before anyone
who is familiar with PPM tells me that we didn't need to download
and keep those files locally, I knew that. I also knew that PPM
is sometimes awkward to configure via firewalls, and that
sometimes the repositories don't always work the way we'd hope. I
do it that way because it suits me.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6</A> <A HREF="installation_en.html#toc5.6">Getting Spider</A>
</H2>

<P>Get the current version of the DX Spider distribution. This needs
to be v1.50 or later. You've got two ways (currently) of getting
this; either get a CVS update from sourceforge (if you don't know
what this is, then it isn't for you) or get the latest "official"
release from:</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.dxcluster.org/download/index.html">http://www.dxcluster.org/download/index.html</A></P>
<P>or if you want the lastest snapshot of CVS version (which is produced 
every night):-</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.dxcluster.org/download/CVSlatest.tgz">http://www.dxcluster.org/download/CVSlatest.tgz</A></P>
<P>This is generally the best one to go for as it is completely up to
date. However, there is always the very slight chance that it might
unstable. Generally, there will be a note on the website if this is 
the case. </P>

<P>The only difference between "CVSlatest.tgz" and the latest
"official" release version is that it is more up to date. <B>Do not confuse 
the "CVSlatest.tgz" file with "Downloading from Sourceforge with CVS" - they
are two quite different things.</B>  "Downloading from Sourceforge with CVS" is
explained in a section within the Admin manual.</P>

<P>If you go down the CVS route (ie installing WinCVS as explained in the Admin
manual and downloaded from sourceforge), then everything will be nicely
installed on your local disk. If you got the CVSlatest.tgz file, unzip 
(
<A HREF="http://www.winzip.com">winzip</A>) it to "C:\".  
This is an important point since paths are included within the .tgz 
file.  Make sure you unzip to the root directory of whichever drive you use...
"C:\" or "D:\" or .., not "C:\spider."  If you double click on CVSlatest.tgz, 
WinZip should open with a dialogue box that says the Archive contains a single
file (CVSlatest.tar) and asks whether WinZip should decompress it to a 
temporary fold and then open it.  Say "Yes" and then you will get the typical 
Classical WinZip listing of files ready for extraction.  Remember, extract 
them to your desired root directory ("C:\" or "D:\" or ...).  The following 
examples assume that you put it on drive "C:\", for convenience.</P>
