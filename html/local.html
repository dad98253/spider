	<h4>Introduction</h4>

	The DXSpider system is designed to be extensible, to facilitate experimentation and
	self-training in both Amateur Radio and Programming.

	<p>Having said all of that it is also designed so that it should be relatively easy to solve
	  some real world problems that we have in the DX Cluster network as well as allow the implementation
	  and testing of new protocols relatively safely.

	<h4>What is it?</h4>

	The mechanism I have chosen to allow people to do their own thing, is a perl <tt>.pm</tt> file called
	<b>Local.pm</b>. It is simply a perl package with its own address space, which has a number of defined
	subroutines called from certain places in the daemon code. I have provided a "blank" version for you 
	to modify. 

	<h4>Where is it?</h4>

	The template is <b>/spider/perl/Local.pm</b>. This file should be
	copied into <b>/spider/local</b> and then modified to your taste.

	<p>At the moment, the template's format and standard functions are
	not really finalised, but I won't take away the functions that are
	currently there and I won't rename them. I reserve the right to
	add to them!

    <p>As and when I get a clearer idea of what people might wish to do with
	  it and how, I will add to the documentation on this page. So for now:
	  this is it!
