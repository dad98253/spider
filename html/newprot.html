<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><br>
For some time now it has become obvious that the original AK1A protocol has
become stretched to beyond breaking point. Some attempts have been made to
extend it, but none have done what is actually required: which is to throw it
away completely and start from scratch.</p>

<p>This is an attempt at starting again.</p>

<h3>Design Criteria</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The protocol shall be open, published and available for any author to
    use.</li>
  <li>The protocol shall versioned, to allow easy upgrade.</li>
  <li>The protocol shall be layered to allow the use of different transport
    mechanisms (eg: radio, UDP, TCP, multicast).</li>
  <li>Sentences in the protocol shall be capable of being verified as being
    unaltered.</li>
  <li>all sentences shall have an originating node, a serial number and a
    destination. These fields must not be altered by intermediate nodes.</li>
  <li>all sentences shall have similar fields in the same order.</li>
  <li>sentences shall be in latin-1 and must not contain any characters other
    than those between 0x20 and 0x7e. Any characters outside of this range
    will be HTML escaped (viz: converted into the form '%', hex digit, hex
    digit; eg: carriage return (0x0d) is converted to '%0D').</li>
  <li>There shall be a mechanism for verifying "sensitive" information and/or
    connections.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Definitions</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>&lt;callsign&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A callsign can contain the characters [0-9A-Z\-/]. It is always in
      upper case.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;nodecall&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A callsign of a node. It can contain the same characters as a
      &lt;callsign&gt;</dd>
  <dt>&lt;origin&gt;</dt>
    <dd>The callsign of the originating node, it is a &lt;nodecall&gt;.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;destination&gt;</dt>
    <dd>The callsign of the destination node, this could be a
      &lt;nodecall&gt; or empty (which implies that this is a broadcast).</dd>
  <dt>&lt;touser&gt;</dt>
    <dd>The callsign of a user to which this sentence is directed. It is a
      &lt;callsign&gt; or empty.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;fromuser&gt;</dt>
    <dd>The callsign of the user from which this sentence originally come
      came from. It is a &lt;callsign&gt;.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;serial&gt;</dt>
    <dd>The serial number of this sentence. It is a number between 0 and
    9999.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;time&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A time in standard 'time_t' format, the number of seconds since 00:00
      1st Jan 1970 (the 'epoch'), the output of the standard system 'time()'
      subroutine call in both unix and MS-Dos/Windows.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;minutes&gt;</dt>
    <dd>The number of minutes since the epoch. This is actually &lt;time&gt;
      / 60 with no remainder.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;flags&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A bit field containing various binary values.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;digit&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A character, representing a numeral, befween '0' and '9'.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;hex digit&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A character, representing a hexadecimal numeral (a value between
      0-&gt;15 [a nibble]), '0'-&gt;'9' and 'A'-&gt;'F'.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;field&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A part of a protocol sentence.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;freq&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A frequency, in kilohertz with an optional (single digit) decimal
      part (ie both 14001 and 14325.1 are valid).</dd>
  <dt>&lt;text&gt;</dt>
    <dd>Some text in ISO-Latin-1 in both upper and lower case.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;cs&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A checksum of two &lt;hex digits&gt;</dd>
  <dt>&lt;cr&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A carriage return character (0x0d)</dd>
  <dt>&lt;lf&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A line feed character (0x0a)</dd>
</dl>

<p></p>

<h3>The Protocol</h3>

<p></p>

<p>Each protocol line is separate and distinct. This is a "datagram" style
protocol. Each protocol line is called a "sentence" and begins with the
string "DX" in upper case, followed by two digits. The sentence is terminated
by a &lt;cr&gt; or a &lt;lf&gt; character or both. Internally, the
terminating characters should be discarded completely and the sentence
processed without.</p>

<p>The character set used shall be ISO-Latin-1, with only the characters 0x20
-&gt; 0x7e permitted within a sentence. All other characters shall be "HTML
Escaped" which is that they shall be replaced by the three character scheme
of '%', &lt;hex digit&gt;, &lt;hex digit&gt;.</p>

<p>The sentence is split up into &lt;fields&gt; which are delimited by the
'|' character (0x7c). If the '|' character occurs within a &lt;field&gt; it
shall be replaced by the string '%7C'.</p>

<p>There is no intrinsic maximum length of a sentence. Having said that,
there will be some underlying maximum lengths implied by the transport
mechanisms employed. Because one of those transport mechanisms is likely to
be AX25 in UI mode. It is recommended that broadcast sentences shall be no
more than 200 bytes in length.</p>

<p>All sentences shall have a &lt;checksum&gt; in a separate &lt;field&gt; at
the end. The checksum is simply the sum, modulo 256, of all the characters of
the sentence except for the final &lt;field&gt; separator and the two &lt;hex
digits&gt; of the checksum itself.  The purpose of the checksum is to check
that no intermediate node has changed the sentence. It is assumed that the
underlying transport mechanisms will deal with communications errors.</p>

<p>All sentences shall have an &lt;origin&gt;, a &lt;serial&gt; and a
&lt;destination&gt; number. The &lt;destination&gt; can be empty which implies
that this sentence is to be broadcast. The &lt;serial&gt; number is a global
number, which is used for all sentences originating at a node, that is
incremented modulo 10000, and is used to determine duplicate or out of date
sentences.</p>

<p>So the generic form of a sentence is:-</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="code">
  DX99|&lt;origin&gt;|&lt;serial&gt;|&lt;destination&gt;|...|&lt;cs&gt;</blockquote>

<p></p>
