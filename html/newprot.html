<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><br>
For some time now it has become obvious that the original AK1A protocol has
become stretched to beyond breaking point. Some attempts have been made to
extend it, but none have done what is actually required: which is to throw it
away completely and start from scratch.</p>

<p>This is an attempt at starting again. In fit of originality I am calling
it "New Protocol" or "NP" for short</p>

<h3>Design Criteria</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The protocol shall be open, published and available for any author to
    use.</li>
  <li>The protocol shall versioned, to allow easy upgrade.</li>
  <li>The protocol shall be layered to allow the use of different transport
    mechanisms (eg: radio, UDP, TCP, multicast).</li>
  <li>Sentences in the protocol shall be capable of being verified as being
    unaltered.</li>
  <li>all sentences shall have an originating node, a serial number and a
    destination. These fields must not be altered by intermediate nodes.</li>
  <li>all sentences shall have similar fields in the same order.</li>
  <li>sentences shall be in latin-1 and must not contain any characters other
    than those between 0x20 and 0x7e. Any characters outside of this range
    will be HTML escaped (viz: converted into the form '%', hex digit, hex
    digit; eg: carriage return (0x0d) is converted to '%0D').</li>
  <li>There shall be a mechanism for verifying "sensitive" information and/or
    connections.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Definitions</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>&lt;callsign&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A callsign can contain the characters [0-9A-Z\-/]. It is always in
      upper case.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;nodecall&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A callsign of a node. It can contain the same characters as a
      &lt;callsign&gt;</dd>
  <dt>&lt;origin&gt;</dt>
    <dd>The callsign of the originating node, it is a &lt;nodecall&gt;.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;destination&gt;</dt>
    <dd>The callsign of the destination node, this could be a
      &lt;nodecall&gt; or empty (which implies that this is a broadcast).</dd>
  <dt>&lt;touser&gt;</dt>
    <dd>The callsign of a user to which this sentence is directed. It is a
      &lt;callsign&gt; or empty.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;fromuser&gt;</dt>
    <dd>The callsign of the user from which this sentence originally come
      came from. It is a &lt;callsign&gt;.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;serial&gt;</dt>
    <dd>The serial number of this sentence. It is a number between 0 and
    9999.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;time&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A time in standard 'time_t' format, the number of seconds since 00:00
      1st Jan 1970 (the 'epoch'), the output of the standard system 'time()'
      subroutine call in both unix and MS-Dos/Windows.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;minutes&gt;</dt>
    <dd>The number of minutes since the epoch. This is actually &lt;time&gt;
      / 60 with no remainder.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;flags&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A bit field containing various binary values.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;digit&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A character, representing a numeral, befween '0' and '9'.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;hex digit&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A character, representing a hexadecimal numeral (a value between
      0-&gt;15 [a nibble]), '0'-&gt;'9' and 'A'-&gt;'F'.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;field&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A part of a protocol sentence.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;freq&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A frequency, in kilohertz with an optional (single digit) decimal
      part (ie both 14001 and 14325.1 are valid).</dd>
  <dt>&lt;text&gt;</dt>
    <dd>Some text in ISO-Latin-1 in both upper and lower case.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;cs&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A checksum of two &lt;hex digits&gt;</dd>
  <dt>&lt;cr&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A carriage return character (0x0d)</dd>
  <dt>&lt;lf&gt;</dt>
    <dd>A line feed character (0x0a)</dd>
</dl>

<p></p>

<h3>The Protocol</h3>

<p></p>

<p>Each protocol line is separate and distinct and is called a "sentence".
This is a "datagram" style protocol. Each protocol line is called a
"sentence" and begins with the string "QX" in upper case, followed by two
digits. The sentence is terminated by a &lt;cr&gt; or a &lt;lf&gt; character
or both. Internally, the terminating characters should be discarded
completely and the sentence processed without.</p>

<p>The character set used shall be ISO-Latin-1, with only the characters 0x20
-&gt; 0x7e permitted within a sentence. All other characters shall be "HTML
Escaped" which is that they shall be replaced by the three character scheme
of '%', &lt;hex digit&gt;, &lt;hex digit&gt;.</p>

<p>The sentence is split up into &lt;fields&gt; which are delimited by the
'|' character (0x7c). If the '|' character occurs within a &lt;field&gt; it
shall be replaced by the string '%7C'.</p>

<p>There is no intrinsic maximum length of a sentence. Having said that,
there will be some underlying maximum lengths implied by the transport
mechanisms employed. Because one of those transport mechanisms is likely to
be AX25 in UI mode. It is recommended that broadcast sentences shall be no
more than 200 bytes in length.</p>

<p>All sentences shall have a &lt;checksum&gt; in a separate &lt;field&gt; at
the end. The checksum is simply the sum, modulo 256, of all the characters of
the sentence except for the final &lt;field&gt; separator and the two &lt;hex
digits&gt; of the checksum itself.  The purpose of the checksum is to check
that no intermediate node has changed the sentence. It is assumed that the
underlying transport mechanisms will deal with communications errors.</p>

<p>All sentences shall have an &lt;origin&gt; and a &lt;destination&gt;
number. The &lt;destination&gt; can be empty which implies that this sentence
is to be broadcast. </p>

<p>So the generic form of a sentence is:-</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote class="code">
  QX99|&lt;destination&gt;|&lt;origin&gt;|...|&lt;cs&gt;</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>Some examples:-</p>

<blockquote class="code">
  QX01|GB7TLH|GB7DJK|1|DXSpider:1.48:53.287|90001FFF|5234FE12|DE450A30|F4<br>
  QX01|GB7DJK|GB7TLH|1|DXSpider:1.49:60.45|90002010|AD412458|4532DA56|A1<br>
  QX11||GB7TLH|1|G1TLH|FR0G|164563|14001.1|Easy|53<br>
  QX10||GB7TLH|2|G1TLH|SYSOP|GB7TLH rebooting|4A<br>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>Some fields are split further into subfields. The separator character
shall be ' :' .</p>

<p>Some sentences will have serial numbers associated with them which
functions both as a generation number and as an aid to deduplication. The
particular usage for each type of sentence is discussed later, but the
general form will be as a modulo 10000 number (0-9999).</p>

<p></p>

<h1>Initialisation</h1>

<p>When a node wishes to speak NP it shall send a "QX01" initialisation
sentence to the other node on connection. It does not wait, it connects and
sends. Both sides of the connection send simultaniously and symetrically. The
fields currently in this sentence are:-</p>

<p><span class="code">QX01|&lt;destination&gt;|&lt;origin&gt;|&lt;protocol
version&gt;|&lt;software
info&gt;|&lt;time&gt;|&lt;random&gt;|&lt;challange&gt;|&lt;cs&gt;</span> </p>

<p>All NP nodes <span style="font-weight: bold">shall<span
style="font-weight: normal"> use a cryptograph</span></span>ic challenge to
determine that the node that they are talking to is correct. In this
protocol, wherever a challenge is mandated, the challenge field will be the
last field before the checksum and shall include the whole of the sentence
upto that point as the "salt" to that challenge. </p>

<p>Because we are not yet sufficiently paranoid to include full crytography,
we will use the standard 32 bit CCITT CRC algorithm on a shared secret
phrase, each side shall have a different phrase each known to both sides.
Each connection shall have a different pair of phrases. Each phrase shall be
at least 40 characters long.</p>

<p>Each sentence that uses a challenge shall include some random element of
at least 8 characters. The &lt;time&gt; field (if included) is not
sufficient!</p>

<p>Getting back to the initialisation sentence  </p>
