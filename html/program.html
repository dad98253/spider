	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	
	All the commands in the DXSpider system are 'soft', that is they are bits of
	perl code that are put into specific places in the <tt>/spider</tt> directory tree. 
	
	<p>By putting them in a specific place and calling them &lt;command>.pl, they become
	  commands - in real time. Such is the magic of 
	  <a href="http://www.perl.com">perl</a>.

	<h4>Directory Structure</h4>

	The directory structure is very simple:-
	<table border=2>
	  <tr><td>/spider</td><td>the main directory</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>/spider/data</td><td>where generated and/or reference data goes</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>/spider/data/spots/&lt;year>/&lt;day>.dat</td><td>one day's worth of spots</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>/spider/data/debug/&lt;year>/&lt;day>.dat</td><td>one day's worth of console debugging</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>/spider/data/log/&lt;year>/&lt;month>.dat</td><td>one month's worth of Logging info including things like rcmd, announces, talks etc</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>/spider/data/wwv/&lt;year>/&lt;month>.dat</td><td>one month's worth of WWV</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>/spider/msg</td><td>the messages directory</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>/spider/packclus/files</td><td>the files directory</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>/spider/packclus/bulletin</td><td>the bulletins directory</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>/spider/perl</td><td>where the issued program code lives</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>/spider/local</td><td>where your experimental/site specific programs go</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>/spider/cmd</td><td>where the issued command code lives</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>/spider/local_cmd</td><td>where your experimental command code goes</td></tr>
	</table>

	<p>A command is put in full as a file under the 'cmd' directory tree, for example, 
	  <tt>announce</tt> lives in <tt>/spider/cmd/announce.pl</tt> and <tt>show/dx</tt> lives
	  in <tt>/spider/cmd/show/dx.pl</tt>. 

	<p>In general terms I don't like the habit of the standard packet cluster software has
	  of taking the DEC VMS command paradigm to the extreme that it has. So I have adopted
	  the convention of separating commands from arguments. So <tt>sh/dx/10 20</tt> is input
	  on the DXSpider system as <tt>sh/dx 10 on 20m</tt>. This is rather contentious.

	<P>In order to maintain a larger level of compatibility, there is an <tt>Aliases</tt> which
	  lives in <tt>/spider/cmd</tt> (or can be overidden by one in <tt>local_cmd</tt>). This file
	  takes standard expressions, parses command lines and produces DXSpider compatible versions
	  of the old Packet Cluster commands. Currently, however, it doesn't do a 100% job because
	  the functionality of the new commands is different (and hopefully better).

	<P>In addition, in the <tt>/spider/perl</tt> directory (overidden by ...) there is 
	  the <tt>Messages</tt> file. This is the file where all the system messages will be stored
	  (because of laziness on my part this isn't currently the case). You will see instances
	  of its use like <tt>$self->msg(&lt;string>&nbsp;[,$arg..])</tt>. This call uses
	  <tt>$self</tt> to determine what language you are in, to return you the correct message.
	  The way arguments are passed to the routine, mean that you can reorder the arguments
	  in your message to suit your language without changing the actual code.

	  <p>When you roll your own commands, put
	  your messages in your own copy of the <tt>Messages</tt> file and don't forget
	  to send me the patches for that as well the command itself.
                            
	<p>When I issue a new version or patches for an existing version then only files in
	  the <tt>/spider/cmd</tt> and <tt>/spider/perl</tt> directories will normally be altered.
	  Occasionally, one or two of the reference files in <tt>/spider/data</tt> may be altered.
	  The only files likely to be affected are <tt>bands.pl</tt> and <tt>prefix_data.pl</tt>.

	<p>As it says in the next section, <b>PLEASE</b> experiment in the local directories! It will
	  save a lot of pain when patching code. Having said that, if you have been playing, then 
	  remember to remove or rename any files with new releases that claim to have incorporated 
	  your modifications, otherwise <EM>it will continue to use the old ones in your local 
		directories!</em>

	<h4>Hints, Tips and Exhortations</h4>

	<ol>

		<p><li>Every command that can used on the command line lives in either
		this directory ('cmd') or in a local version ('local_cmd'). You are
		cajoled or ordered not to and generally discouraged from altering the
		commands in the 'cmd' directory. You can put local copies in the
		'local_cmd' directory and they will override the standard ones.

		<p><li>If you want to play, do it in the 'local_cmd' directory. It's
		very easy and reasonably safe. You can override a command whilst the
		cluster is running.  Compilation errors will simply give you error
		messages, it won't stop the cluster running - this only happens if you
		mess with the internals to the extent that it gets confused...
		
		<p><li>A command is a piece of perl, it is simply a small snippet of
		program that is dynamically loaded into the cluster on invocation from
		the command line. The last modification time is used to determine
		whether to reload it.
		
		<p><li>New (or altered) commands are available for test the moment you
		save them.
		
		<p><li>A command is placed into the appropriate directory with a '.pl'
		appended to the end. So the 'show/qra' command lives in
		'cmd/show/qra.pl' (or a local version would be in
		'local_cmd/show/qra.pl'.
		
		<p><li>For the security conscious, potentially dubious
		characters command line args (i.e. not [A-Za-z0-9_/]) are
		converted to their hex equivalents. This will almost certainly
		mean that the user will get an error message (unless you have
		your secret squirrel hat on and have deliberately put such
		commands up [in 'local_cmd' of course]).

		<p><li>The snippets of program you put here are wrapped in an eval { }
		and are subroutines derived from the DXChannel class. They effectively
		the following declaration :-
		<p><pre>
  sub Emb_<cmdname>($self, $args)
  {
     ...
     your code here
     ...
  }
		</pre>

		<p><li>slash characters are replaced by '_' so the equivalent name for
		'show/qth' is 'Emb_show_qth'.

		<p><li>you would normally do a 'my ($self, $line) = @_;' as the first
		thing. There are a complete set of accessors for DXUser, DXCommandmode,
		DXChannel and most other classes and these are the recommended way of getting at
		the contents of these classes.  A fairly standard start might be:-
		<p><pre>
  my ($self, $line) = @_;
  my @args = split /\s+/, $line;
  my $call = $self->call;
  my $user = $self->user;
  my @out;

  # check privileges
  return (1, $self->msg('e5')) if $self->priv < 5;

  ....
  ....
  some perl code here
  ....
  ....
  return (1, @out);
		</pre>

		<li>$line (in this example) is the rest of the line after the command (as a string).

		<p><li>You are responsible for maintaining user security. If you have
		a command that does something a normal system shouldn't be allowed to
		do or see, there is $self->priv (using the above example) which gives
		you the running privilege level of the channel. USE IT!

		<p><li>The privilege levels used in the standard code are:-

		<p>0 - is the normal user privilege.
		<p>1 - is the remote user privilage (you need to be at least 1 to get
		  any output from an <tt>rcmd</tt>).
		<p>5 - is the normal external sysop privilege, give this to commands that
		  you are prepared to let non-local sysops use.
		<p>8 - a <em>very</em> trusted, probably internet rather than radio connected
		  remote sysop.
		<p>9 - the do anything console privilege. 
		
		<p>The sysop privilege is for things that you are prepared for remote
		sysops and clusters to do or see.
		
		<p>A console privilege can only be executed locally (at least if you have
		correctly installed the client program in inetd or ax25d).
		
		<p>The set/priv command can only be executed by a console privileged 
		session.

		<p><li>You must return a list with a 0 or 1 as the first element. 1
		means success and 0 means fail. Each element of the list which follows
		is assumed to be one line for output. Don't put \n characters at the
		end of an element (the client will put the correct one in if required
		[but see below]).
		
		<p><li><b>DO NOT</b>send output direct to the user unless you <em>really</em>
		mean it (i.e. it is never appropriate for this command to be used remotely
		as an <tt>rcmd</tt> or from some kind of batch or cron file.

		<p>What you do instead is create a list using
		<pre>
my @out;
        </pre> 
		and then <tt>push</tt> stuff onto it. Each element on the list will
		become a line of output. For exmaple:-
		<pre>
#
# set a user's password
#
# Copyright (c) 1998 Iain Phillips G0RDI
# 21-Dec-1998
#
# Syntax:	set/pass &lt;password> &lt;callsign>
#
  
my ($self, $line) = @_;
my @args = split /\s+/, $line;
my $call;
my $pass = shift @args;
my @out;
my $user;
my $ref;
  
return (1, $self->msg('e5')) if $self->priv < 9;
  
foreach $call (@args) {
    $call = uc $call;
    if ($ref = DXUser->get_current($call)) {
        $ref->passwd($pass);
  	    $ref->put();
  		push @out, $self->msg("password", $call);
  	} else {
  		push @out, $self->msg('e3', 'User record for', $call);
  	}
}
return (1, @out);
	    </pre>
		a more complicated example:-
		<pre>
#
# display the band data
#
# Copyright (c) 1998 - Dirk Koopman G1TLH
#
# $Id$
#

#$DB::single = 1;

my ($self, $line) = @_;
my @f = split /\s+/, $line;
my @bands;
my $band;
my @out;
my $i;

if (!$line) {
	@bands = sort { Bands::get($a)->band->[0] &lt;=> Bands::get($b)->band->[0] } Bands::get_keys();
	push @out, "Bands Available:-";
	foreach $band (@bands) {
		my $ref = Bands::get($band)->band;
		my $s = sprintf "%10s: ", $band;
		for ($i = 0; $i &lt; $#{$ref}; $i += 2) {
			my $from = $ref->[$i];
			my $to = $ref->[$i+1];
			$s .= ", " if $i;
			$s .= "$from -> $to";
		}
		push @out, $s;
	} 
	push @out, "Regions Available:-";
	@bands = Bands::get_region_keys();
	foreach $band (@bands) {
		my $ref = Bands::get_region($band);
		my $s = sprintf("%10s: ", $band ) . join(' ', @{$ref}); 
		push @out, $s;
	}
}

return (1, @out)
        </pre>
		<p><li>As this is perl and it is very easy to alter stuff to get it
		correct, I would like to see some intelligent argument processing,
		e.g. if you can have one callsign, you can have several. Interpret
		your arguments; so for example:-

		<pre>
  set/qra jo02lq       - sets your own locator to JO02LQ
  set/qra g1tlh jo02lq - sets G1TLH's locator (if you are allowed)
  or
  show/qra in92jo      - displays the bearing and distance to 
                         IN92JO using your lat/long or locator
  show/qra jn56in in92jo  - bearing and distance between two
                            locators
        </pre>

		<p><li>It is important that you remember when you have tie
		hashes using MLDBM et al. If you do a
		<tt>DXUser->get($call)</tt> you will get a different (older)
		thing than the one in <tt>$self->user</tt>. This is almost
		certainly NOT what you want if want to modify a user that is
		currently connected. Either use <tt>$self->user</tt> or, if
		you want another user, use <tt>DXUser->get_current($call)</tt>

		<p><li>If you want to debug something, start the cluster.pl up thus:-
		<pre>
  perl -d cluster.pl
  dbg> r
		</pre>
		Then you can go into debug mode at anytime by using the command :-
		<pre> 
  debug
        </pre>
  or you can put the line:-
		<pre>
  $DB::single = 1;
		</pre>
		in an appropriate place in a command. This will only have an effect
		if you are running in perl debug mode.
		
		<p>If all else fails (actually it is very simple), just stick print
		  commands in everywhere and the output will appear on the cluster.pl
		  screen.

		<p><li>Anything you output with a > as the last character is taken to
		mean that this is a prompt and will not have a \r or \n appended to
		it in the client for telnet sessions (only).

		<p><li>help is kept in <tt>/spider/cmd/Command_<lang>.hlp</tt> files.
		The format of the help files should be self explanatory, but they are
		explained further in the files themselves.

		<p><li>PLEASE add your new commands to the Commands_*.hlp file so that
		people know about and how to use them!
