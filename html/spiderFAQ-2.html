<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 How can I get Spider to restart automatically if it crashes?</A>
</H2>

<P>Put this line into /etc/inittab ..
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
DX:3:respawn:/bin/su -c "/usr/bin/perl -w /spider/perl/cluster.pl" sysop > /dev/tty7
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Run <EM>telinit q</EM> as root.  Spider will restart so be aware.  However, any
time you reboot, cluster.pl will start in tty7 and if it crashes, it should restart ok.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 How can I monitor traffic to and from a node or user?</A>
</H2>

<P>There are 2 ways to achieve this.  You can use the <EM>tail</EM> command like this ..
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
tail -f /spider/data/debug/167.dat |grep G0VGS
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>or in later versions of Spider, there is a command called <EM>watchdbg</EM> in which
case you simply type ..
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
watchdbg G0VGS
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 My neighbouring node cannot use the RCMD command to me, he just keeps getting the "tut tut" message.</A>
</H2>

<P>Assuming that the permissions are set correctly (perm level 5 required), it could be
that the home_node is set incorrectly.  You can reset the home_node using the <EM>spoof</EM>
command like this ..
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
spoof gb7adx set/home gb7adx
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Assuming that the node_call you are changing is gb7adx.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 I do not seem to be sending any bulletin mail to my link partners, what is wrong?</A>
</H2>

<P>There is a file in /spider/msg called forward.pl.issue.  Rename this to
forward.pl and edit it to meet your requirements.  To make the changes
take effect, use the command load/forward.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 I have set up my partner node with bulletin mail.  Now I am sending</A>
him all my bulletins!  How do I stop it?</H2>

<P>Unless you tell Spider otherwise, when you set a node up as a forwarding
partner it will send all the mail with the bulletin addresses you have
configured.  To stop this happening you need to tell the cluster that
all mail has already been sent.  To do this use the catchup command.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 The WWV command does not seem to work.. why is that?</A>
</H2>

<P>The WWV command is not supported in DXSpider.  This decision has been
taken as there is a perfectly good automated and accurate WWV posting made
once per hour from N4TY.  In the past, inaccurate postings have been made
from some users and this will prevent this happening.
