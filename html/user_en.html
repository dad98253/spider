	<h4>Introduction</h4>

	<p>This is the list of user commands currently available within the DX Spider DX Cluster system.</p>
	<p>It is automatically generated from the system help files.</p>

    <h4>The Commands</h4>

	<ul>
<li><a name="L1"><b>ANNOUNCE &lt;text&gt;</b></a> Send an announcement to LOCAL users only
<br><br>
&lt;text&gt; is the text of the announcement you wish to broadcast 
 
 <br><br>
<li><a name="L2"><b>ANNOUNCE FULL &lt;text&gt;</b></a> Send an announcement cluster wide
<br><br>
This will send your announcement cluster wide
 
 <br><br>
<li><a name="L3"><b>APROPOS &lt;string&gt;</b></a> Search help database for &lt;string&gt;
<br><br>
Search the help database for &lt;string&gt; (it isn't case sensitive), and print
 the names of all the commands that may be relevant.
 
 <br><br>
<li><a name="L4"><b>BYE</b></a> Exit from the cluster
<br><br>
This will disconnect you from the cluster
 
 <br><br>
<li><a name="L5"><b>DBAVAIL</b></a> Show a list of all the Databases in the system
<br><br>
Title says it all really, this command lists all the databases defined
 in the system. It is also aliased to SHOW/COMMAND.
 
 <br><br>
<li><a name="L6"><b>DBSHOW &lt;dbname&gt; &lt;key&gt;</b></a> Display an entry, if it exists, in a database
<br><br>
This is the generic user interface to the database to the database system.
 It is expected that the sysop will add an entry to the local Aliases file
 so that users can use the more familiar AK1A style of enquiry such as:
 
 <br><br>
<pre>
  SH/BUCK G1TLH
 </pre>

 <br><br>
but if he hasn't and the database really does exist (use DBAVAIL or
 SHOW/COMMAND to find out) you can do the same thing with:
 
 <br><br>
<pre>
  DBSHOW buck G1TLH
 </pre>

 <br><br>
<li><a name="L7"><b>DIRECTORY</b></a> List messages 
<br><br>

 personal message. If there is a '-' between the message number and the
 'p' then this indicates that the message has been read.

on &lt;band&gt;       - eg 160m 20m 2m 23cm 6mm
 on &lt;region&gt;     - eg hf vhf uhf shf      (see SHOW/BANDS)
    
 <br><br>
&lt;number&gt;        - the number of spots you want
 &lt;from&gt;-&lt;to&gt;     - &lt;from&gt; spot no &lt;to&gt; spot no in the selected list
    
 <br><br>
&lt;prefix&gt;        - for a spotted callsign beginning with &lt;prefix&gt;
 *&lt;suffix&gt;       - for a spotted callsign ending in &lt;suffix&gt;
 *&lt;string&gt;*      - for a spotted callsign containing &lt;string&gt;
    
 <br><br>
day &lt;number&gt;    - starting &lt;number&gt; days ago
 day &lt;from&gt;-&lt;to&gt; - &lt;from&gt; days &lt;to&gt; days ago
    
 <br><br>
info &lt;text&gt;     - any spots containing &lt;text&gt; in the info or remarks
    
 <br><br>
by &lt;call&gt;       - any spots spotted by &lt;call&gt; (spotter &lt;call&gt; is the 
 <pre>
                  same).
 </pre>

 <br><br>
qsl             - this automatically looks for any qsl info on the call
 <pre>
                  held in the spot database.
 </pre>

 <br><br>
iota [&lt;iota&gt;]   - If the iota island number is missing it will look for
 <pre>
                  the string iota and anything which looks like an iota
                   island number. If you specify then it will look for  
                   that island.
 </pre>

 <br><br>
qra [&lt;locator&gt;] - this will look for the specific locator if you specify
 <pre>
                  one or else anything that looks like a locator.
 </pre>
   
 <br><br>
e.g. 
    
 <br><br>
<pre>
   SH/DX 9m0
    SH/DX on 20m info iota
    SH/DX 9a on vhf day 30
    SH/DX rf1p qsl
    SH/DX iota 
    SH/DX iota eu-064
    SH/DX qra jn86
 </pre>
  
 <br><br>
<li><a name="L48"><b>SHOW/DXCC &lt;prefix&gt;</b></a> Interrogate the spot database by country
<br><br>
This command takes the &lt;prefix&gt; (which can be a full or partial 
 callsign if desired), looks up which internal country number it is
 and then displays all the spots as per SH/DX for that country.
    
 <br><br>
The options for SHOW/DX also apply to this command.   
 e.g. 
    
 <br><br>
<pre>
   SH/DXCC G
    SH/DXCC W on 20m info iota
 </pre>

 <br><br>
<li><a name="L49"><b>SHOW/FILES [&lt;filearea&gt; [&lt;string&gt;]]</b></a> List the contents of a filearea
<br><br>
SHOW/FILES on its own will show you a list of the various fileareas
 available on the system. To see the contents of a particular file
 area type:-
 <pre>
   SH/FILES &lt;filearea&gt;
 </pre>
where &lt;filearea&gt; is the name of the filearea you want to see the 
 contents of.
 
 <br><br>
You can also use shell globbing characters like '*' and '?' in a
 string to see a selection of files in a filearea eg:-
 <pre>
   SH/FILES bulletins arld*
 </pre>

 <br><br>
See also TYPE - to see the contents of a file.
 
 <br><br>
<li><a name="L50"><b>SHOW/MUF &lt;prefix&gt; [&lt;hours&gt;][long]</b></a> Show the likely propagation to a prefix
<br><br>
This command allow you to estimate the likelihood of you contacting
 a station with the prefix you have specified. The output assumes a modest
 power of 20dBW and receiver sensitivity of -123dBm (about 0.15muV/10dB SINAD)
 
 <br><br>
The result predicts the most likely operating frequencies and signal
 levels for high frequency (shortwave) radio propagation paths on
 specified days of the year and hours of the day. It is most useful for
 paths between 250 km and 6000 km, but can be used with reduced accuracy
 for paths shorter or longer than this.
 
 <br><br>
The command uses a routine MINIMUF 3.5 developed by the U.S. Navy and
 used to predict the MUF given the predicted flux, day of the year,
 hour of the day and geographic coordinates of the transmitter and
 receiver. This routine is reasonably accurate for the purposes here,
 with a claimed RMS error of 3.8 MHz, but much smaller and less complex
 than the programs used by major shortwave broadcasting organizations,
 such as the Voice of America.
 
 <br><br>
The command will display some header information detailing its
 assumptions, together with the locations, latitude and longitudes and
 bearings. It will then show UTC (UT), local time at the other end
 (LT), calculate the MUFs, Sun zenith angle at the midpoint of the path
 (Zen) and the likely signal strengths. Then for each frequency for which
 the system thinks there is a likelihood of a circuit it prints a value.
 
 <br><br>
The value is currently a likely S meter reading based on the conventional
 6dB / S point scale. If the value has a '+' appended it means that it is
 1/2 an S point stronger. If the value is preceeded by an 'm' it means that
 there is likely to be much fading and by an 's' that the signal is likely
 to be noisy.  
 
 <br><br>
By default SHOW/MUF will show the next two hours worth of data. You
 can specify anything up to 24 hours worth of data by appending the no of
 hours required after the prefix. For example:-
 
 <br><br>
<pre>
  SH/MUF W
 </pre>

 <br><br>
produces:
 
 <br><br>
<pre>
  RxSens: -123 dBM SFI: 159   R: 193   Month: 10   Day: 21
   Power :   20 dBW    Distance:  6283 km    Delay: 22.4 ms
   Location                       Lat / Long           Azim
   East Dereham, Norfolk          52 41 N 0 57 E         47
   United-States-W                43 0 N 87 54 W        299
   UT LT  MUF Zen  1.8  3.5  7.0 10.1 14.0 18.1 21.0 24.9 28.0 50.0
   18 23 11.5 -35  mS0+ mS2   S3
   19  0 11.2 -41  mS0+ mS2   S3
 </pre>

 <br><br>
indicating that you will have weak, fading circuits on top band and 
 80m but usable signals on 40m (about S3).
 
 <br><br>
inputing:-
 
 <br><br>
<pre>
  SH/MUF W 24
 </pre>

 <br><br>
will get you the above display, but with the next 24 hours worth of
 propagation data.
 
 <br><br>
<pre>
  SH/MUF W L 24
   SH/MUF W 24 Long
 </pre>

 <br><br>
Gives you an estimate of the long path propagation characterics. It
 should be noted that the figures will probably not be very useful, nor
 terrible accurate, but it is included for completeness.
 
 <br><br>
<li><a name="L51"><b>SHOW/PREFIX &lt;callsign&gt;</b></a> Interrogate the prefix database 
<br><br>
This command takes the &lt;callsign&gt; (which can be a full or partial 
 callsign or a prefix), looks up which internal country number 
 it is and then displays all the relevant prefixes for that country
 together with the internal country no, the CQ and ITU regions. 
 
 <br><br>
See also SHOW/DXCC
 
 <br><br>
<li><a name="L52"><b>SHOW/SUN [&lt;callsign&gt;|&lt;prefix&gt;]</b></a> Display sunrise and sunset times
<br><br>
Show the sunrise and sunset times for a callsign (if it is known to the
 cluster), a prefix or, if nothing is specified, at your QTH (if you have
 remembered to set your location using SET/LOCATION or SET/QRA). If all else
 fails it will show the sunrise and set times for the node that you are 
 connected to.
 
 <br><br>
You can enter more than one prefix or callsign:-
 
 <br><br>
<pre>
  SH/SUN G1TLH G8TIC W9
 </pre>

 <br><br>
<li><a name="L53"><b>SHOW/WWV</b></a> Show last 10 WWV broadcasts
<br><br>
Display the most recent WWV information that has been received by the system
 
 <br><br>
<li><a name="L54"><b>SHOW/WWV &lt;n&gt;</b></a> Show last &lt;n&gt; WWV broadcasts
<br><br>
Display the most recent WWV information that has been received by the system
 
 <br><br>
<li><a name="L55"><b>SYSOP</b></a> Regain your privileges if you login remotely
<br><br>
The system automatically reduces your privilege level to that of a
 normal user if you login in remotely. This command allows you to
 regain your normal privilege level. It uses the normal system: five
 numbers are returned that are indexes into the character array that is
 your assigned password (see SET/PASSWORD). The indexes start from
 zero.
 
 <br><br>
You are expected to return a string which contains the characters
 required in the correct order. You may intersperse those characters
 with others to obscure your reply for any watchers. For example (and
 these values are for explanation :-):
 
 <br><br>
<pre>
  password = 012345678901234567890123456789
   &gt; sysop
   22 10 15 17 3
 </pre>
you type:-
 <pre>
 aa2bbbb0ccc5ddd7xxx3n
  or 2 0 5 7 3
  or 20573
 </pre>

 <br><br>
They will all match. If there is no password you will still be offered
 numbers but nothing will happen when you input a string. Any match is
 case sensitive.
 
 <br><br>
<li><a name="L56"><b>TALK &lt;call&gt; &gt; &lt;node&gt; &lt;text&gt;</b></a> Send a text message to another station via a node
<br><br>
Send a short message to any other station that is visible on the cluster
 system. You can send it to anyone you can see with a SHOW/CONFIGURATION 
 command, they don't have to be connected locally.
 
 <br><br>
The second form of TALK is used when other cluster nodes are connected
 with restricted information. This usually means that they don't send 
 the user information usually associated with logging on and off the cluster.
 
 <br><br>
If you know that G3JNB is likely to be present on GB7TLH, but you can only
 see GB7TLH in the SH/C list but with no users, then you would use the
 second form of the talk message.
 
 <br><br>
<li><a name="L57"><b>TALK &lt;call&gt; &lt;text&gt;</b></a> Send a text message to another station
<br><br>
Send a short message to any other station that is visible on the cluster
 system. You can send it to anyone you can see with a SHOW/CONFIGURATION 
 command, they don't have to be connected locally.
 
 <br><br>
The second form of TALK is used when other cluster nodes are connected
 with restricted information. This usually means that they don't send

 <br><br>
If you know that G3JNB is likely to be present on GB7TLH, but you can only
 see GB7TLH in the SH/C list but with no users, then you would use the
 second form of the talk message.
 
 <br><br>
<li><a name="L58"><b>TYPE &lt;filearea&gt;/&lt;name&gt;</b></a> Look at the contents of a file in one of the fileareas
<br><br>
Type out the contents of a file in a filearea. So, for example, in 
 filearea 'bulletins' you want to look at file 'arld051' you would 
 enter:-
 <pre>
   TYPE bulletins/arld051
 </pre>

 <br><br>
See also SHOW/FILES to see what fileareas are available and a 
 list of content.
 
 <br><br>
<li><a name="L59"><b>UNSET/ANNOUNCE</b></a> Stop announce messages coming out on your terminal
