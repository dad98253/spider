<H2><A NAME="s12">12. The DXSpider command reference</A></H2>

<P>Below is a complete list of commands available from the cluster prompt.
These are listed below in alphabetical order. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.1">12.1 accept/announce</A>
</H2>

<P><CODE><B>accept/announce [0-9] &lt;pattern&gt;</B> Set an accept filter
line for announce</CODE>
<P>
<P>Create an 'accept this announce' line for a filter. 
<P>An accept filter line means that if the announce matches this filter it is
passed onto the user. See HELP FILTERS for more info. Please read this
to understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief later on.
<P>You can use any of the following things in this line:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  info &lt;string>            eg: iota or qsl
  by &lt;prefixes>            eg: G,M,2         
  origin &lt;prefixes>
  origin_dxcc &lt;numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
  origin_itu &lt;numbers>
  origin_zone &lt;numbers>
  by_dxcc &lt;numbers>
  by_itu &lt;numbers>
  by_zone &lt;numbers>
  channel &lt;prefixes>
  wx 1                     filter WX announces
  dest &lt;prefixes>          eg: 6MUK,WDX      (distros)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>some examples:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  acc/ann dest 6MUK
  acc/ann 2 by_zone 14,15,16
  (this could be all on one line: acc/ann dest 6MUK or by_zone 14,15,16)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>or
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  acc/ann by G,M,2 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This filter would only allow announces that were posted buy UK stations.  
You can use the tag 'all' to accept everything eg:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  acc/ann all
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>but this probably for advanced users...
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.2">12.2 accept/spots </A>
</H2>

<P><CODE><B>accept/spots [0-9] &lt;pattern&gt;</B> Set an accept filter line for spots</CODE>
<P>
<P>Create an 'accept this spot' line for a filter.
<P>
<P>An accept filter line means that if the spot matches this filter it is
passed onto the user. See HELP FILTERS for more info. Please read this
to understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief later on.
<P>You can use any of the following things in this line:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  freq &lt;range>           eg: 0/30000 or hf or hf/cw or 6m,4m,2m
  on &lt;range>             same as 'freq'
  call &lt;prefixes>        eg: G,PA,HB9
  info &lt;string>          eg: iota or qsl
  by &lt;prefixes>            
  call_dxcc &lt;numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
  call_itu &lt;numbers>
  call_zone &lt;numbers>
  by_dxcc &lt;numbers>
  by_itu &lt;numbers>
  by_zone &lt;numbers>
  origin &lt;prefixes>
  channel &lt;prefixes>
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>For frequencies, you can use any of the band names defined in
SHOW/BANDS and you can use a subband name like: cw, rtty, data, ssb -
thus: hf/ssb. You can also just have a simple range like: 0/30000 -
this is more efficient than saying simply: freq HF (but don't get
too hung up about that)
<P>some examples:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  acc/spot 1 on hf/cw
  acc/spot 2 on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You can use the tag 'all' to accept everything, eg:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  acc/spot 3 all
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>but this probably for advanced users...
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.3">12.3 accept/wcy </A>
</H2>

<P><CODE><B>accept/wcy [0-9] &lt;pattern&gt;</B> set an accept WCY filter</CODE>
<P>
<P>It is unlikely that you will want to do this, but if you do then you can
filter on the following fields:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  by &lt;prefixes>            eg: G,M,2         
  origin &lt;prefixes>

  origin_itu &lt;numbers>
  origin_zone &lt;numbers>
  by_dxcc &lt;numbers>
  by_itu &lt;numbers>
  by_zone &lt;numbers>
  channel &lt;prefixes>
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>There are no examples because WCY Broadcasts only come from one place and
you either want them or not (see UNSET/WCY if you don't want them).
<P>This command is really provided for future use.
<P>See HELP FILTER for information.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.4">12.4 accept/wwv </A>
</H2>

<P><CODE><B>accept/wwv [0-9] &lt;pattern&gt;</B> Set an accept WWV filter</CODE>
<P>
<P>It is unlikely that you will want to do this, but if you do then you can
filter on the following fields:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  by &lt;prefixes>            eg: G,M,2

  by_dxcc &lt;numbers>
  by_itu &lt;numbers>

<P>for example 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  accept/wwv by_zone 4
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>is probably the only useful thing to do (which will only show WWV broadcasts
by stations in the US).
<P>See HELP FILTER for information.

<P>
<P>This command allows you to clear (remove) a line in a spot filter or to 
remove the whole filter.
<P>If you have a filter:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  acc/spot 1 on hf/cw
  acc/spot 2 on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>and you say:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  clear/spot 1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>you will be left with:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

</H2>

<P><CODE><B>dbshow &lt;dbname&gt; &lt;key&gt;</B> Display an entry, if it exists, in a database</CODE>
<P>
<P>This is the generic user interface to the database to the database system.
It is expected that the sysop will add an entry to the local Aliases file
so that users can use the more familiar AK1A style of enquiry such as:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  SH/BUCK G1TLH
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>but if he hasn't and the database really does exist (use DBAVAIL or
SHOW/COMMAND to find out) you can do the same thing with:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  DBSHOW buck G1TLH
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<P>
<P>List the messages in the messages directory.
<P>If there is a 'p' one space after the message number then it is a 
personal message. If there is a '-' between the message number and the
'p' then this indicates that the message has been read.
<P>You can use shell escape characters such as '*' and '?' in the &lt;call&gt;
fields.
<P>You can combine some of the various directory commands together eg:-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   DIR TO G1TLH 5
or 
   DIR SUBJECT IOTA 200-250
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You can abbreviate all the commands to one letter and use ak1a syntax:-

it will mark the message as personal and send it to the cluster node that
that callsign is connected to.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

the likely propagation to &lt;prefix&gt;</CODE>
<P>
<P>This command allow you to estimate the likelihood of you contacting
a station with the prefix you have specified. The output assumes a modest
power of 20dBW and receiver sensitivity of -123dBm (about 0.15muV/10dB SINAD)
<P>The result predicts the most likely operating frequencies and signal
levels for high frequency (shortwave) radio propagation paths on
specified days of the year and hours of the day. It is most useful for
paths between 250 km and 6000 km, but can be used with reduced accuracy
for paths shorter or longer than this.
<P>The command uses a routine MINIMUF 3.5 developed by the U.S. Navy and
used to predict the MUF given the predicted flux, day of the year,
hour of the day and geographic coordinates of the transmitter and
receiver. This routine is reasonably accurate for the purposes here,
with a claimed RMS error of 3.8 MHz, but much smaller and less complex
than the programs used by major shortwave broadcasting organizations,
such as the Voice of America.
<P>The command will display some header information detailing its
assumptions, together with the locations, latitude and longitudes and
bearings. It will then show UTC (UT), local time at the other end
(LT), calculate the MUFs, Sun zenith angle at the midpoint of the path
(Zen) and the likely signal strengths. Then for each frequency for which
the system thinks there is a likelihood of a circuit it prints a value.
<P>The value is currently a likely S meter reading based on the conventional
6dB / S point scale. If the value has a '+' appended it means that it is
1/2 an S point stronger. If the value is preceeded by an 'm' it means that
there is likely to be much fading and by an 's' that the signal is likely
to be noisy.  
<P>By default SHOW/MUF will show the next two hours worth of data. You
can specify anything up to 24 hours worth of data by appending the no of
hours required after the prefix. For example:-
