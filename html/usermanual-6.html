</H2>

<P>Occasionally, you may wish to post something that does not fall into 
the normal parameters for a DX callout.  You may wish to tell 
everybody connected that 10 FM is open for example, or ask if anyone 
knows the QSL manager for a certain callsign etc.  You can do this 
using the <B>ANNOUNCE</B> command.
<P><B>Example:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
announce 10 FM is open in IO84NB to europe.

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>That would let everyone know locally that this was the case, however
it would not be forwarded to other nodes connected.  To send
announcements to other connected nodes as well, you would use the
<B>FULL</B> extension.
<P><B>Example:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
announce full Anyone seen EA7WA today?
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Be cautious in your use of announce full.  There are many other tools
available to get the information you require and the judicious use of
this command is frowned upon as it creates a great deal of traffic
across the network.

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Listing announcements.</A>
</H2>

<P>You can list previous announcements in the standard format with the 
<B>SHOW</B> command.  As before you can list just the last 5 or as 
many as you wish.
