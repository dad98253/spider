<P>You can send a single comment or start a dedicated talk session to 
another user by using the <B>TALK</B> command. </P>

<P>Talk mode is used to send a one line comment or greeting to a 
specific user connected either at your node or another in the 
network.  You can also enter into a dedicated talk session with 
another user.  Talks will be automatically forwarded to other nodes 
if the station you are talking to is not connected locally. 
You can find out who is connected by using the 
<B>SHOW/CONFIGURATION</B> command, (described earlier).</P>
<P><B>Examples:</B></P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 
talk g0rdi Having a good day Iain?
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This example would send the line "Having a good day Iain?" to the
user g0rdi but would leave you in normal mode.  </P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
talk g0rdi
Entering Talkmode, /EX to end, /&lt;cmd> to run a command
Talk (G0RDI)>
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>As you can see, you can still run commands whilst in talk mode.
Simply prefix the command with a / like /sh/dx and you will get
the expected output.
If the user is connected to another node, you may have to use a 
slightly extended version of the <B>TALK</B> command.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
talk g0rdi > gb7djk
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>To exit talk mode, you issue the command <B>/ex</B>. </P>
<P>Whilst in talk mode you will still receive DX spots.  This means that
you can chat to a friend whilst working DX.  </P>
