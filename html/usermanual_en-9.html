<H2><A NAME="s9">9.</A> <A HREF="usermanual_en.html#toc9">Mail.</A></H2>

<P>You can send and receive both personal mail and bulletins with DXSpider 
quite easily.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1</A> <A HREF="usermanual_en.html#toc9.1">The "directory" command.</A>
</H2>

<P>To list mail you would use the <B>DIRECTORY</B> command.  On its 
own, this command will output the last ten messages received by the 
node, either to or from yourself or bulletins such as "DX" and "ALL".
As with other commands you can display more by specifying a number 
with the command.  You should be aware that Spider will accept
these commands by separating with either a slash or a space, so
<EM>dir new</EM> and <EM>dir/new</EM> work in the same way.</P>
<P><B>Example:</B></P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
directory
directory/20
directory 20
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Of course most of the time you will only want to list new mail sent 
to you personally since your last login.  However you might also like 
to check for general mail received by the node.  In fact if there is 
new mail for you, the cluster will tell you when you login. You will 
also be informed if new mail arrives for you during the time you are 
logged in.
Mail is not only sent to callsigns though.  Mail can also be sent to 
subjects like "all" or "local" or "dx" etc.  You can treat these 
bulletins in the same way as personal mail with the directory 
command.</P>
<P><B>Examples:</B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
directory/new
directory/own
directory/own/10
directory/all
directory/from &lt;call>
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  </P>
<P>The last option will only show mail from a callsign if it was sent to
you personally or was sent as a bulletin.  There are some additional
commands and these can be found in the DXSpider Command Reference section.</P>

<P>The first column is the actual message number.  If the message is a
personal one to you, you will see a letter 'p' after this number.  If
the message has been read, there will be a '-' between the message
number and the 'p'.  This only works for personal messages.  The next
column shows the file size of the message.  The third column shows the
address the message was sent to and the next column shows who sent it.
The rest is fairly self-explanatory.</P>
<P>Reading a message is as simple as typing read, followed by the 
message number that you wish to read.</P>
<P><B>Example:</B></P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

read 25

</P>
<P>will read message number 25.  However the mail will be displayed in it's
entirety unless you specify a page length. You can set your page length
to any number you like and when the message reaches that number of lines
you will get a prompt giving you options.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3</A> <A HREF="usermanual_en.html#toc9.3">Sending mail.</A>
</H2>

<P>Sending mail is done in the time honoured way.  First you specify
a recipient for the message, then you will be prompted for a subject.
Once you have done this you will be asked to type your message.
Please remember that there is no automatic word wrap, so unless you
are using a client that wraps lines automatically, remember to hit
return at the end of each line.</P>
<P><B>Example:</B></P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
send m0azm
Enter Subject (30 characters):
See you Thursday
Enter Message /EX to send or /ABORT to exit
Hi Ian,            
Just a quick note to say that I can make Thursday after all.  The
appointment I had has cancelled so we are go!
Cheers
Ian

</P>
<P>At this point you can either hit return and enter /ex to send the
message or use /abort at any time to abort it.  You can now display
the message in the normal way.  There are several send options and 
these are listed in the Command Set section.  These include sending
mail to several recipients and asking for a return receipt.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss9.4">9.4</A> <A HREF="usermanual_en.html#toc9.4">Replying to mail.</A>
</H2>

<P>If mail is addressed to you or to a bulletin address, you can use the
<B>REPLY</B> command to reply to it.  Using this command, the 
subject will be automatically set for you as "Re: subject", whatever 
the subject was. </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.5">9.5</A> <A HREF="usermanual_en.html#toc9.5">Deleting mail</A>
</H2>

<P>To delete a message, you use the <EM>delete</EM> command.
You can only delete messages sent to or received by yourself.  
Bulletins are dealt with automatically or by the sysop.</P>
