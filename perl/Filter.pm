# The User/Sysop Filter module
#
# The way this works is that the filter routine is actually
# a predefined function that returns 0 if it is OK and 1 if it
# is not when presented with a list of things.
#
# This set of routines provide a means of maintaining the filter
# scripts which are compiled in when an entity connects.

# use the commands accept/spot|ann|wwv|wcy and reject/spot|ann|wwv|wcy
# also show/filter spot|ann|wwv|wcy
#
# The filters live in a directory tree of their own in $main::root/filter
#
# Each type of filter (e.g. spot, wwv) live in a tree of their own so you
# can have different filters for different things for the same callsign.

# the OLD instructions!
#
# Each filter file has the same structure:-
#
# <some comment>
# @in = (
#      [ action, fieldno, fieldsort, comparison, action data ],
#      ...
# );
#
# The action is usually 1 or 0 but could be any numeric value
#
# The fieldno is the field no in the list of fields that is presented
# to 'Filter::it' 
#
# The fieldsort is the type of field that we are dealing with which 
# currently can be 'a', 'n', 'r' or 'd'. 'a' is alphanumeric, 'n' is 
# numeric, 'r' is ranges of pairs of numeric values and 'd' is default.
#
# Filter::it basically goes thru the list of comparisons from top to
# bottom and when one matches it will return the action and the action data as a list. 
# The fields
# are the element nos of the list that is presented to Filter::it. Element
# 0 is the first field of the list.
#

#
# takes the reference to the filter (the first argument) and applies
# it to the subsequent arguments and returns the action specified.
