#
# The User/Sysop Filter module
#
# The way this works is that the filter routine is actually
# a predefined function that returns 0 if it is OK and 1 if it
# is not when presented with a list of things.
#
# This set of routines provide a means of maintaining the filter
# scripts which are compiled in when an entity connects.
