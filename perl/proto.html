	<h4>Some thoughts</h4>

    <ol>
	  <li>The protocol must be capable of being multi/broadcast.
      <li>The format must regular.
      <li>All packets will have a to, from and date field and a checksum of
		some kind.
	  <li>space is a premium, therefore I am prepared to break layering rules
		in specific cases to avoid duplicating fields. E.g. in AX25 using
		callsign fields as part of the data (which means reconstructing the
		packets from ax25 to be like you expect)
	  <li>the protocol will continue to be ascii for simplicity of use.
	</ol>

	<h4>packet format</h4>

	The overall format of a packet shall look like this:-

	<p>
	  <table border=3>
		<tr>
		  <td width="20%"><b>Field</b></td>
		  <td width="80%"><b>Description</b></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td width="20%"><b>OP Code</b></td>
		  <td width="80%">
			
			This will be 'B' for now, but will be extended when multicasting
			comes into being, the possible values are:-<br>
			<table>
			  <tr><td>A</td><td>ACK</td></tr>
			  <tr><td>B</td><td>Broadcast</td></tr>
			  <tr><td>C</td><td>Catch up</td></tr>
			  <tr><td>J</td><td>Join</td></tr>
			  <tr><td>L</td><td>Leave</td></tr>
			  <tr><td>M</td><td>Multicast</td></tr>
			  <tr><td>N</td><td>NAK</td></tr>
			  <tr><td>P</td><td>Point to Point</td></tr>
			  <tr><td>T</td><td>Time (ping with time)</td></tr>
			</table>
		  </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td width="20%"><b>From Address</b></td>
		  <td width="80%">
			This will always be the originating (cluster) callsign and shall 
			<emph>never</emph> be changed. The word cluster is in brackets because
			it is envisaged that 'connected' callsigns will eventually speak the
			the same protocol as the clusters.
		  </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td width="20%"><b>To Address</b></td>
		  <td width="80%">
			The <i>To</i> address can be anything at all that is likely
			to be meaningful to a cluster program, it could be a callsign, a 'group' name of
			some sort (eg <tt>6MUK</tt>) or it could be empty, indicating a broadcast 
		  </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td width="20%"><b>Date/Time/Count</b></td>
		  <td width="80%">
			This is a unix time_t, in hex (ie 8 characters) with an optional
			2 byte hex count on the end which can allow up to 256 protocol messages to be originated
			a second. Programs must allow for both 8 or 10 digit hex numbers
		  </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td width="20%"><b>Data</b></td>
		  <td width="80%">
			The actual cluster data. The data in this field can contain only
			ascii data. Any non ascii data shall be converted to <tt>%XX</tt> format, where 
			<tt>XX</tt> is the hex equivalent of the character represented, certain special
			characters in the data such as '%', '|' and '^' shall also be converted. Although
			it is envisaged that most data will be ascii, things like mail files can and
			will contain newline characters and these will be converted.
			<br><br>It is suggested that the raw version of the data in this packet be no
			more than 128 characters, if it any packets are likely to be routed over
			ax25 bearers. However, programs should be prepared to accept 1024 characters (after
			decoding) for point to point wire links and routed data.
		  </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td width="20%"><b>Checksum</b></td>
		  <td width="80%">
			This is calculated as the simple arithmetic checksum, modulo 256, 
			of the whole packet excluding
			this field and any preceeding field separator,  as two hex digits
			this checksum is designed solely to pick up errors in any connections between 
			this protocol and lower layers - where hopefully real CRC checking is done 
		  </td>
		</tr>
	  </table>
	</P>
  
	<p>
	  Each field in the above packet shall be separated by the '|' character <b>EXCEPT</b> the
	  <tt>op code</tt> which is concatenated onto the <tt>from</tt> field. The '|' character 
	  must not appear in any field in the overall packet, it is the data providers responsibility
	  make sure this happens. If it is necessary for operations there can be a locally generated
	  newline sequence added on the end of the packet for sending or delimiting purposes
	  which is stripped off before presenting the packet for decoding.  
	</p>

	<p>
	  A typical packet might look like:- <br><br>
	  <code>
		BGB7DJK||8BCF65DE|DX^G1TLH^M0BAA^144123^Humungous Signal!|A8<BR>
		BGB7DJK|SYSOP|8BCF65FC|AN^G1TLH^What @$%7C%5E!** condxs?|5C<BR>
		BGB7DJK|GB7BAA|8BCF670102|TA^G1TLH^G8TIC^Baaaaaaaaaaa|FD<BR>
      </code>
    <p>

    <p>
	  As mentioned earlier, astute readers will see that there is a mix up of lower
	  layer data with higher. This is deliberate (as well as potentially messy), but it saves 
	  characters and promotes regularity on format. Apart from anything else, most directed
	  data actually needs to pass from cluster to cluster and it is important for the higher
	  layers to know where a packet originated. Also higher layers need to address packets to
	  other clusters or groups and there would otherwise be considerable duplication.
	</P>

	<p>
	  If a packet fails a checksum, then it is silently dropped - for now. When reliable
	  multicast comes in, other actions will occur at this level. In any event, higher level
	  functions that require some state to be maintained between packets (eg mail transfer)
	  should make their own arrangements in case reliable multicast isn't available between
	  two cluster nodes.
