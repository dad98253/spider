<sect>Linux Installation 

<sect1>Introduction

<P>
This section describes the installation of DX Spider v1.50 on a 
<htmlurl url="http://www.redhat.com" name="RedHat"> Linux Distribution.
Wherever possible I will try to include differences for other distributions.  

<P>
I am assuming a general knowledge of Linux and its commands.  You should 
know how to use <em>tar</em> and how to edit files using your favourite editor.

<P>
The crucial ingredient for all of this is 
<htmlurl url="http://www.perl.org" name="Perl">.  Earlier versions of
Spider required perl 5.004, however it is now <it>STRONGLY</it> recommended
that you use at least version 5.005_03 as this is the version being used
in the development of Spider.

<P>
In addition to the standard Red Hat distribution you will require the 
following modules from <htmlurl url="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/" name="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/"> , please note however that with later versions of perl, some of these
modules may be included with the distribution.  Get the modules anyway and try
to install as below.  If they complain, they are probably already a part of your
perl distribution.

<P>
<itemize>
<item> <htmlurl url="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Data/Data-Dumper-2.10.tar.gz" name="Data-Dumper-2.101.tar.gz">
<item> <htmlurl url="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Date/TimeDate-1.10.tar.gz" name="TimeDate-1.10.tar.gz">
<item> <htmlurl url="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/IO/IO-1.20.tar.gz" name="IO-1.20.tar.gz (for perl 5.00403 and lower)">
<item> <htmlurl url="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Net/Net-Telnet-3.03.tar.gz" name="Net-Telnet-3.03.tar.gz">
<item> <htmlurl url="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Curses/Curses-1.06.tar.gz" name="Curses-1.06.tar.gz">
<item> <htmlurl url="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Time/Time-HiRes-01.20.tar.gz" name="Time-HiRes-01.20.tar.gz">
<item> <htmlurl url="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Digest/Digest-SHA1-2.01.tar.gz" name="Digest-SHA1-2.01.tar.gz">
</itemize>

<P>
Copy the CPAN modules listed above to a convenient place on your computer. One good 
place would be /usr/local/packages, and the instructions which follow will assume that 
that's where you have put them.

<P>
Log in as 'root', and make sure you're at '/root' before you continue. Here are exactly the commands you must issue next: -

<verb>
# tar xvfz /usr/local/packages/Data-Dumper-2.101.tar.gz
# cd Data-Dumper-2.101
# perl Makefile.PL
# make test
# make install
# cd ..
#
# tar xvfz /usr/local/packages/TimeDate-1.10.tar.gz
# cd TimeDate-1.10
# perl Makefile.PL
# make test
# make install
# cd ..
#
# tar xvfz /usr/local/packages/IO-1.20.tar.gz
# cd IO-1.20
# perl Makefile.PL
# make test
# make install UNINST=1
# cd ..
#
# tar xvfz /usr/local/packages/Net-Telnet-3.03.tar.gz
# cd Net-Telnet-3.02
# perl Makefile.PL
# make test
# make install
# cd ..
#
# tar xvfz /usr/local/packages/Curses-1.06.tar.gz
# cd Curses-1.06
# perl Makefile.PL
# make test
# make install
# cd ..
#
# tar xvfz /usr/local/packages/Time-HiRes-01.20.tar.gz 
# cd Time-HiRes-01.20
# perl Makefile.PL
# make test
# make install
# cd ..
#
# tar xvfz /usr/local/packages/Digest-SHA1-2.01.tar.gz
# cd Digest-SHA1-2.01
# perl Makefile.PL
# make test
# make install
# cd ..
</verb>

<P>
Do not fall into the trap of thinking they're all the same, just because they 
nearly are! Pay particular attention to the instructions of <em>IO</em>, above.


<sect1>Preparation

<P>
I will assume that you have already downloaded the latest tarball of 
the DXSpider software and are ready to install it. I am assuming version 
1.50 for this section but of course you would use the latest version.

<P>
Login as root and create a user to run the cluster under.  <bf><it>UNDER 
NO CIRCUMSTANCES USE ROOT AS THIS USER!</it></bf>.  I am going to use 
the name <em>sysop</em>.  You can call it anything you wish.  Depending 
on your security requirements you may wish to use an existing user, 
however this is your own choice.

<tscreen><verb>
# adduser -m sysop
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
For SuSE distributions, the command would be ..

<tscreen><verb>
# useradd -m sysop
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
Now set a password for the user ...

<tscreen><verb>
# passwd sysop
# New UNIX password:
# Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Installing the software

<P>
Now to unpack the DX Spider distribution, set symbolic links and group 
permissions.  Copy the tarball to /home/sysop and do the following.

<tscreen><verb>
# cd ~sysop
# tar xvfz spider-1.50.tar.gz
# ln -s ~sysop/spider /spider
# groupadd -g 251 spider       (or another number)
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
If you do not have the command <em>groupadd</em> available to you simply 
add a line in /etc/group by hand.

<tscreen><verb>
# vi /etc/group                (or your favorite editor)
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
You also need to add some others to the group, including your own callsign 
(this will be used as an alias) and root.  The finished line in /etc/group 
should look something like this

<tt>
spider:x:251:sysop,g0vgs,root
</tt>

<P>
The next step is to set the permissions on the Spider directory tree and files ....

<tscreen><verb>
# chown -R sysop.spider spider
# find . -type d -exec chmod 2775 {} \;
# find . -type f -exec chmod 775 {} \;
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
This last step allows various users of the group <em>spider</em> to have 
write access to all the directories.  This is not really needed just yet 
but will be useful when web interfaces start to appear.

<P>
Finally, you need to fix the permissions on the ax25_call and netrom_call 
programs.  Check where they are with the <em>locate</em> command and alter 
the permissions with the <em>chmod</em> command like this ..

<tscreen><verb>
# chown root ax25_call netrom_call
# chmod 4775 ax25_call netrom_call
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Setting callsigns etc

<P>
Now login to your machine as the user you created earlier.  In my case that 
user is called <em>sysop</em>.  Once logged in, issue the following commands ....

<tscreen><verb>
$ cd /spider
$ mkdir local
$ mkdir local_cmd
$ cp perl/DXVars.pm.issue local/DXVars.pm
$ cd local
$ vi DXVars.pm (or your favourite editor)
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
Using the distributed DXVars.pm as a a template, set your cluster callsign, 
sysop callsign and other user info to suit your own environment. 

<tscreen><verb>
$mycall = "GB7DJK";	
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
This is the call sign of your cluster.  If you use an SSID then include it here
also.

<tscreen><verb>
$myalias = "G1TLH";
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
This is the sysop user callsign, normally your own.

<P>
<bf>PLEASE USE CAPITAL LETTERS FOR CALLSIGNS</bf>

<P>
Note that this a perl file which will be parsed and executed as part of the 
cluster. If you get it wrong then perl will complain when you start the cluster 
process.  It is important only to alter the text of any section.  Some of the 
lines look a little odd.  Take this line for example ....

<tt>
$myemail = "ianmaude\@btinternet.com";
</tt>

<P>
There appears to be an extra slash in there.  However this has to be there 
for the file to work so leave it in.
		
<P>
DON'T alter any file in /spider/perl, they are overwritten with every
release. Any files or commands you place in /spider/local or /spider/local_cmd 
will automagically be used in preference to the ones in /spider/perl EVEN 
while the cluster is running!

<P>
Save the new file and change directory to ../perl ....

<tscreen><verb>
$ cd ../perl
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
Now type the following command which creates the basic user file with you as 
the sysop.

<tscreen><verb>
$ ./create_sysop.pl
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>The client program

<P>
In earlier versions of Spider, all the processes were Perl scripts.  This
was fine but with a lot of users your computer memory would soon be used up.
To combat this a new client was written in "C".  This client only works for
<em>incoming</em> connects at the moment.  Before you can use it though it
has to be "made".  CD to /spider/src and type <em>make</em>.  You
should see the output on your screen and hopefully now have a small C program
called <em>client</em>.  Leave it in this directory.


<sect1>Starting up for the first time

<P>
We can now bring spider up for the first time and see if all is well or not!  
It should look something like this ...

<tscreen><verb>
$ ./cluster.pl
DXSpider DX Cluster Version 1.50
Copyright (c) 1998 Dirk Koopman G1TLH
loading prefixes ...
loading band data ...
loading user file system ...
starting listener ...
reading existing message headers
reading cron jobs
orft we jolly well go ...
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
If all is well then login on another term or console as <em>sysop</em> and 
cd to /spider/src.  Now issue the following command ...

<tscreen><verb>
$ ./client
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
This should log you into the cluster as the sysop under the alias callsign we 
set earlier.  In this case the callsign is G0VGS.  The cluster callsign is set 
in the DXVars.pm file in /spider/local.  In this case we will assume that this 
was set as GB7MBC.  You should therefore see this when you login ....

<tscreen><verb>
G0VGS de GB7MBC 19-Nov-1999 2150Z >
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
If you do, congratulations!  If not, look over the instructions again, you 
have probably missed something out.  You can shut spider down again with the 
command ....

<tscreen><verb>
shutdown
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
and both the cluster and the client should return to Linux prompts.


<sect>Linux quick installation guide

<P>
This section is designed for experienced Spider sysops who want to install
Spider from scratch.  It is simply a check list of things that need to be
done without any explanations.  The name in brackets at the end of each line
is the user that should be doing that process.

<itemize>
<item>Login as root
<item>Get the additional CPAN modules and install them (root)
<item>Create the "sysop" user and set a password (root)
<item>Put the Spider tarball in ~sysop and untar it (root)
<item>ln -s ~sysop/spider /spider (root)
<item>groupadd -g 251 spider (root)
<item>Add any more users you need to the group entry in /etc/group (root)
<item>Set the permissions on the spider tree (root)
<item>Fix permissions on ax25_call and netrom_call (root)
<item>Login as the sysop user
<item>cd to /spider (sysop)
<item>mkdir local (sysop)
<item>mkdir local_cmd (sysop)
<item>cp perl/DXVars.pm.issue local/DXVars.pm (sysop)
<item>cd to /spider/local and edit DXVars to set your details (sysop)
<item>cd ../perl (sysop)
<item>./create_sysop.pl (sysop)
<item>./cluster.pl (sysop)
</itemize>

<P>
Spider should now be running and you should be able to login using the
client program.

<itemize>
<item>Login as root
<item>Enter the correct line in ax25d.conf (root)
<item>Enter the correct line in /etc/services (root)
<item>Enter the correct line in /etc/inetd.conf (root)
<item>killall -HUP inetd (root)
</itemize>

<P>
Spider should now be able to accept logins via telnet, netrom and ax25.

<itemize>
<item>Login as sysop
<item>Start the cluster (sysop)
<item>set/node and type for links (sysop)
<item>Write any connect scripts (sysop)
<item>Edit /spider/crontab as required (sysop)
<item>Edit any other files as necessary (sysop)
<item>Set filters, hops and forwarding files (sysop)
<item>Login as root
<item>Enter the correct line in /etc/inittab (root)
</itemize>

<sect>Setting up the AX25 Utilities

<P>
The aim of this section is not to fully cover the installation
and configuration of all the possible ax25 modules.  I will
attempt to cover a simple installation and configure 2 serial
ports as if they had TNC's on them.  I will also show what
additional configuration the DXSpider program requires.

<P>
Please bear in mind that I am basing this section on a RedHat
7.1 distribution, if you are using SuSe or any other distibution
then your mileage may vary.  I will be happy to make any changes
and additions if you email me any errors or distribution specific
requirements.

<P>
You would probably benefit from reading the <htmlurl url="http://www.fokus.gmd.de/linux/HOWTO/html_single/AX25-HOWTO.html#AEN151" name="AX25-HOWTO"> which is much more
comprehensive and an interesting configuration program is also available
called <htmlurl url="http://1409.org/projects/index.html" name="ax25-config"> which
may help you to configure things.

<P>
The following files are extracts from the working files at GB7MBC and
are in daily use.  However, there are many ways that you can configure the
ax25 utils, this is just the one I use, it does not mean it is necessarily
the best or for that matter, the right way!

<sect1>Getting Started

<P>
There are 2 things you need to do initially.  You need to get the
3 files required for the ax25 installation and you need to make
some changes to the kernel configuration.

<P>
The first thing is to get the versions of the ax25 utils that match
your kernel.  You may also wish to get a node package of some kind.
There are 2 main node packages in use of which I shall keep to the
original by Tomi Manninen, OH2BNS as this is included in the ax25
rpms as standard.  The other is <htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/ham/packet/linux/awznode/" name="AWZNode"> by IZ5AWZ.

<P>
NB: The AX25 stuff in 2.4 kernels appears to have been broken until 2.4.18.  I
strongly suggest you get at least this kernel.

<P>
For 2.4 kernels you need these files...

<P>
<itemize>
<item> <htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.rpmfind.net/linux/redhat/7.1/en/powertools/i386/RedHat/RPMS/libax25-0.0.7-7.i386.rpm" name="libax25-0.0.7-7.i386.rpm">
<item> <htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.rpmfind.net/linux/redhat/7.1/en/powertools/i386/RedHat/RPMS/ax25-tools-0.0.6-13.i386.rpm" name="ax25-tools-0.0.6-13.i386.rpm">
<item> <htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.rpmfind.net/linux/redhat/7.1/en/powertools/i386/RedHat/RPMS/ax25-apps-0.0.4-9.i386.rpm" name="ax25-apps-0.0.4-9.i386.rpm">
</itemize>

<sect1>The kernel

<P>
First you need to add Amateur Radio Support to your kernel.  This is
a main menu item and should be easily found.  Within this header you
will find lots of options.  For our purposes you need to enable
Amateur Radio AX.25 Level 2 Protocol, NET/ROM and the Serial Port 
KISS Driver.  For the purposes of this document I will work under the
assumption that you include them in the kernel fully, ie not as modules.
If you need to look at compiling your kernel for ax25 more fully, I would
refer to the excellent 
<htmlurl url="http://www.fokus.gmd.de/linux/HOWTO/html_single/AX25-HOWTO.html#AEN151" name="AX25-HOWTO">

<P>
I should say at this stage that NET/ROM is not mandatory.  If you do not use it
simply ignore any instruction concerning it.

<P>
Now recompile your kernel in the normal way and reboot your system.

<sect1>Installing the RPM's

<P>
Now install the RPM's you downloaded, libax25 first, then ax25-tools,
then ax25-apps.

<tscreen><verb>
rpm -ivh libax25-0.0.7-7.i386.rpm
rpm -ivh ax25-tool-0.0.6-13.i386.rpm
rpm -ivh ax25-apps-0.0.4-9.i386.rpm
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Configuration

<P>
You will find the configuration files in /etc/ax25.  These consist of
several files ...

<itemize>
<item>axports
<item>nrports
<item>nrbroadcast
<item>ax25d.conf
<item>node.conf
</itemize>

<P>
These are the main files. You will find other files but they do not
have any use unless you are wanting to use that particular protocol,
Rose or axip for example.

<P>
NOTE:- before we start it is important to realise that every interface
requires a different SSID.  You should be able to follow this in the
following examples.

<sect1>axports

<P>
This file sets up the ax25 ports you want to use.  An example is below
for a standard TNC2 ...

<tscreen><verb>
#portname   callsign   baudrate   paclen   window   description
 2m         gb7mbc-2   19200      256      2        2m port on 144.900MHz
 4m         gb7mbc-4   19200      256      2        4m port on 70.325MHz
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
Note that the portnames have to be unique.

<P>
The file headings are as follows ...

<verb>
portname	-	The name you will refer to the port by
callsign	-	The ax25 callsign you want to assign to the port
baudrate	-	The speed you communicate between TNC and computer
paclen		-	The maximum packet length for ax25 connections
window		-	The ax25 window parameter.  This is like 'maxframe'
description	-	A textual description of the port
</verb>

<sect1>nrports

<P>
This file sets up the netrom ports you want to use.  An example is below
and includes a port for both cluster and node.  You will see why we need
2 ports later ...

<tscreen><verb>
#portname   callsign   alias   paclen   description
 netrom     gb7mbc-8   BARE    236      Node Netrom Port
 netrom2    gb7mbc-9   MBCDX   236      Cluster Netrom Port
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
Note that the portnames have to be unique.

<P>
The file headings are as follows ...

<verb>
portname	-	The name you will refer to the port by
callsign	-	This is the callsign that NET/ROM traffic from this
                        port will use
alias		-	The NET/ROM alias this port will be assigned
paclen		-	The maximum size of NET/ROM frames transmitted
description	-	A textual description of the port
</verb>

<sect1>nrbroadcast

<P>
This file sets up the netrom broadcast qualities.  An example is below ...

<tscreen><verb>
#axport   min_obs   def_qual   worst_qual   verbose
 4m       5         10         100          1
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
The file headings are as follows ...

<verb>
axport		-	The port name in axports that you wish to broadcast
                        NET/ROM on.
min_obs		-	The minimum obsolescence value for the port
def_qual	-	The default quality for the port
worst_qual	-	The worst quality for the port.  Any routes under
                        this quality will be ignored
verbose		-	This flag determines whether you will only broadcast
                        your own node (0) or all known nodes (1)
</verb>

<sect1>ax25d.conf

<P>
This file controls any incoming ax25 and NET/ROM connections and steers
them to the relevant program.  There are lots of configuration options
you can set here, however they are well covered in the AX25-HOWTO.  For
our purposes I will show a typical set of parameters.  An example is 
below ...

<tscreen><verb>
[gb7mbc-0 via 2m]
parameters    2 1   6  900 *  15  0
NOCALL *  *  *  *  *  *  L
default  * * * * * *  - sysop /spider/src/client client %u ax25

[gb7mbc-1 via 2m]
parameters    2 1   6  900 *  15  0
NOCALL *  *  *  *  *  *  L
default *  *  *  *  *  *  0  root  /usr/sbin/node  node

[gb7mbc-0 via 4m]
parameters    2 1   6  900 *  15  0
NOCALL *  *  *  *  *  *  L
default  * * * * * *  - sysop /spider/src/client client %u ax25

[gb7mbc-1 via 4m]
parameters    2 1   6  900 *  15  0
NOCALL *  *  *  *  *  *  L
default *  *  *  *  *  *  0  root /usr/sbin/node  node

<netrom2>
parameters 1	10 * * * 3 *
NOCALL *  *  *  *  *  *  L
default  * * * * * *  - sysop /spider/src/client client %u ax25

<netrom>
parameters 1    10 * * * 3 *
NOCALL *  *  *  *  *  *  L
default *  *  *  *  *  *  0  root  /usr/sbin/node  node
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
There are a few things to take note of here.  Firstly, all ax25
sections are wrapped in [ ] and all NET/ROM sections are wrapped in
&lt; &gt;.  Secondly you should be able to see that anyone who forgets to
set their callsign in a TNC and tries to connect with the standard
NOCALL set into their TNC will not connect, the 'L' means 'lockout'.
Lastly and importantly, notice the order of the sections.  They are
all done in interface order.

<P>
You should be able to see that the normal line for access to the
cluster is like this ..

<tscreen><verb>
default  * * * * * *  - sysop /spider/src/client client %u ax25
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
however, if you wish your users to be able to use SSID's on their callsigns ..

<tscreen><verb>
default  * * * * * *  - sysop /spider/src/client client %s ax25
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
For most purposes this is not desirable. The only time you probably will
need this is when you need to allow other cluster nodes that are using SSID's
in. In this case it would probably be better to use the first example and
then add a specific line for that node like this:

<tscreen><verb>
GB7DJK-2  * * * * * *  - sysop /spider/src/client client gb7djk-2 ax25
default  * * * * * *  - sysop /spider/src/client client %u ax25
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>node.conf

<P>
For those of you that wish to run the node, you need to set up the
node.conf file.  There are a couple of additional files, node.perms is
very similar to the way ftp permissions are set up in NOS systems and 
node.motd is the message anyone logging into the node will get.
The node.conf file sets all the parameters of the node as you would
expect.  An example is below ...

<tscreen><verb>
# /etc/ax25/node.conf - LinuxNode configuration file
#
# see node.conf(5)

# Idle timeout (seconds).
#
IdleTimeout	1800

# Timeout when gatewaying (seconds).

</verb></tscreen>

<P>
This should be fairly obvious I hope.

<sect1>Getting it all running

<P>
Ok, now we have all the relevant files configured, the next step is to get
it all running.

<P>
The first thing to do is attach the TNC's.  Your TNC's should be in KISS mode
and connected to the serial ports involved.

<P>
You now use the 'kissattach' command to connect the TNC's to the system like this ...

<tscreen><verb>
kissattach /dev/ttyS0 2m 44.131.96.199
kissattach /dev/ttyS1 4m 44.131.96.199
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
Assuming that 44.131.96.199 is your IP address.  The devices ttyS0 and ttyS1 are com1 and
com2 respectively.  Now we can set some parameters ...

<tscreen><verb>
kissparms -p 2m -t 150 -l 150 -s 50 -r 50
kissparms -p 4m -t 150 -l 150 -s 50 -r 50
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
The command 'man kissparms' will give you the explanation of the switches.

<P>
Now we need to attach the NET/ROM ports in the same way ...

<tscreen><verb>
nrattach netrom
nrattach netrom2
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
All of the above can be put in a file and called from /etc/rc.d/rc.local.  Put all
the above commands in a file called rc.ax25 and put a line in rc.local to call it.

<P>
Now you can start the daemons that set everything in motion ...

<tscreen><verb>
ax25d
netromd -i
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
All should now be running.  All that remains is to get the node working for telnet
connections.  If nothing else, this will allow you to connect to the node yourself
to check on connection status etc.  There are 2 files that need to be edited.

<P>
First edit /etc/services and add

<tscreen><verb>
node    3000/tcp     #OH2BNS's Node Software
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
Assuming you want it to run on port 3000

<P>
Now cd /etc/xinetd.d and edit a new file called node.  It should look like this ...

<tscreen><verb>
# default: on
#       unencrypted username/password pairs for authentication.
service node
{
        socket_type     = stream        
        wait            = no
        user            = root
        server          = /usr/sbin/node
        log_on_failure  += USERID
        disable         = no
}
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
You now need to restart the xinetd daemon.  First find out what the PID is
like so ..

<tscreen><verb>
ps auxw |grep xinetd
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
You will get a reply something like this ...

<tscreen><verb>
root       592  0.0  0.1  2256  620 ?        S    Feb07   0:00 xinetd -stayalive -reuse -pidfile /var/run/xinetd.pid
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
The PID or Process ID is 592 in this case so now we can issue the command ...

<tscreen><verb>
kill -HUP 592
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
All should now be operational and you should be able to log into the node by
using a telnet session to the relevant port, like so ...

<tscreen><verb>
telnet localhost 3000
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
If that works, you are just about there.  you should (assuming you have radios connected
to the TNC's) be able to connect out to other stations and receive incoming ax25 and
netrom connections.

<sect>Configuration

<sect1>Allowing ax25 connects from users

<P>
This is dealt with in the previous section
 
<sect1>Allowing telnet connects from users 

<P> 
>From version 1.47 there is a new (more efficient) way of doing this
(see next section) but, if you prefer, the method of doing it described 
here will continue to work just fine.
 
<P>
Allowing telnet connections is quite simple.  Firstly you need to add a line 
in /etc/services to allow connections to a port number, like this ....

<tscreen><verb>
spdlogin   8000/tcp     # spider anonymous login port
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
Then add a line in /etc/inetd.conf like this ....

<tscreen><verb>
spdlogin stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /spider/src/client login telnet
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
Once this is done, you need to restart inetd like this ....

<tscreen><verb>
killall -HUP inetd
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
Now login as <em>sysop</em> and cd spider/src. You can test that spider 
is accepting telnet logins by issuing the following command ....

<tscreen><verb>
./client login telnet
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
You should get a login prompt and on issuing a callsign, you will be given 
access to the cluster.  Note, you will not get a password login.  There seems 
no good reason for a password prompt to be given so it is not asked for.

<P>
Assuming all is well, then try a telnet from your linux console ....

<tscreen><verb>
telnet localhost 8000
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
You should now get the login prompt and be able to login as before.

<sect1>Setting up telnet connects (from 1.47 onwards)

<P>
>From version 1.47 you can choose to allow the perl cluster.pl program to 
allow connections directly (i.e. not via the <tt>/spider/src/client</tt>
interface program). If you are using Windows then this is the only method
available of allowing incoming telnet connections.

<P>
To do this you need first to remove any line that you may previously have set
up in /etc/inetd.conf. Remember to:-

<tscreen><verb>
killall -HUP inetd
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
to make the change happen...

<P>
Having done that, you need to copy the file 
<em>/spider/perl/Listeners.pm</em> to <em>/spider/local</em> and 
then edit it. You will need to uncomment the line containing &dquot;0.0.0.0&dquot; 
and select the correct port to listen on. So that it looks like this:-

<tscreen><verb>
@listen = (
    ["0.0.0.0", 8000],
);
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
As standard, the listener will listen on all interfaces simultaneously. 
If you require more control than this, you can specify each interface 
individually:-

<tscreen><verb>
@listen = (
    ["gb7baa.dxcluster.net", 8000],
    ["44.131.16.2", 6300],
);
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
This will only be successful if the IP addresses on each interface are static. 
If you are using some kind of dynamic IP addressing then the 'default' method 
is the only one that will work.

<P>
Restart the cluster.pl program to enable the listener.

<P>
One important difference with the internal listener is that no echoing 
is done by the cluster program. Users will need to set 'local-echo' on in 
their telnet clients if it isn't set automatically (as per the standards). 
Needless to say this will probably only apply to Windows users. 

<sect1>Setting up for AGW Engine (1.47 onwards)

<P>
AGW Engine is a Windows based ax25 stack. You can connect to an AGW engine 
from Linux as well as Windows based machines.

<P>
In order to enable access to an AGW Engine you need to copy 
<em>/spider/perl/AGWConnect.pm</em> to <em>/spider/local</em> and edit it. 
Specifically you must:-

<itemize>
<item> set <tt>$enable</tt> to 1.
<item> set <tt>$login</tt> and <tt>$passwd</tt> to the values set up in your AGW installation. 
If you haven't set any there, then you should not touch these values.
<item> You can connect to a remote AGW engine (ie on some other machine) by changing <tt>$addr</tt>
and <tt>$port</tt> appropriately.
<item> Restart the cluster.pl program
</itemize>   


<sect1>Setting up node connects

<P>
In order to allow cluster node connections, spider needs to know that the 
connecting callsign is a cluster node.  This is the case whether the connect 
is incoming or outgoing.  In spider this is a simple task and can be done in 
runtime.

<P>
Later versions of Spider can distinguish different software and treat them
differently.  For example, the WCY beacon cannot be handles by AK1A type
nodes as AK1A does not know what to do with PC73.  There are 4 different
types of node at present and although they may not have any major
differences at the moment, it allows for compatibility.  The 4 types are ...

<tscreen><verb>
set/node	(AK1A type)
set/spider
set/dxnet
set/clx
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
For now, we will assume that the cluster we are going to connect to is an
AK1A type node.

<P>
Start up the cluster as you did before and login as the sysop with client.
The cluster node I am wanting to make a connection to is GB7BAA but you would
obviously use whatever callsign you required.  At the prompt type ...

<tscreen><verb>
set/node gb7baa
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
The case does not matter as long as you have a version of DXSpider later than 
1.33.  Earlier versions required the callsign to be in upper case.

<P>
That is now set, it is as simple as that.  To prove it, login on yet another 
console as sysop, cd to spider/src and issue the command ...

<tscreen><verb>
./client gb7baa (using the callsign you set as a node)
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
You should get an initialisation string from DXSpider like this ...

<tscreen><verb>
./client gb7baa
PC38^GB7MBC^~
</verb></tscreen>

If the callsign you just set up as a cluster node is for an incoming connect, 
this is all that needs to be done.  If the connection is to be outgoing then 
a connection script needs to be written.

<P>
Sometimes you make a mistake... Honest, it does happen.  If you want to make a node
back to being a normal user, regardless
of what type it is, do:

<tscreen><verb>
unset/node gb7baa
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Connection scripts

<P>
Because DXSpider operates under Linux, connections can be made using just about 
any protocol;  AX25, NETRom, tcp/ip, ROSE etc are all possible examples.  
Connect scripts live in the /spider/connect directory and are simple ascii files.  
Writing a script for connections is therefore relatively simple.  

<P>
The connect scripts consist of lines which start with the following keywords 
or symbols:-

<descrip>
	
<tag/#/All lines starting with a <tt>#</tt> are ignored, as are completely 
                blank lines.

<tag/timeout/<tt>timeout</tt> followed by a number is the number of seconds to wait for a 
		command to complete. If there is no timeout specified in the script 
		then the default is 60 seconds.

<tag/abort/	<tt>abort</tt> is a regular expression containing one or more strings to look 
		for to abort a connection. This is a perl regular expression and is 
		executed ignoring case.

<tag/connect/<tt>connect</tt> followed by ax25, agw (for Windows users) or telnet and some type dependent 
		information. In the case of a telnet connection, there can be up to 
		two parameters.
		The first is the ip address or hostname of the computer you wish to 
		connect to and the second is the port number you want to use (this 
		can be left out if it is a normal telnet session).
		In the case of an ax25 session then this would normally be a call to
		ax25_call or netrom_call as in the example above. It is your
		responsibility to get your node and other ax25 parameters to work 
		before going down this route!

<tag/'/<tt>'</tt> is the delimiting character for a word or phrase of an expect/send 
		line in a chat type script. The words/phrases normally come in pairs,
 		either can be empty. Each line reads input from the connection until 
		it sees the string (or perl regular expression) contained in the
		left hand string. If the left hand string is empty then it doesn't 
		read or wait for anything. The comparison is done ignoring case.
		When the left hand string has found what it is looking for (if it is)
 		then the right hand string is sent to the connection.
		This process is repeated for every line of chat script. 

<tag/client/<tt>client</tt> starts the connection, put the arguments you would want here 
		if you were starting the client program manually. You only need this 
		if the script has a different name to the callsign you are trying to 
		connect to (i.e. you have a script called other which actually 
		connects to GB7DJK-1 [instead of a script called gb7djk-1]).
</descrip>

<P>
There are many possible ways to configure the script but here are three examples, 
one for a NETRom/AX25 connect, one for AGW engines and one for tcp/ip.  

<tscreen><verb>
timeout 60
abort (Busy|Sorry|Fail)
# don't forget to chmod 4775 netrom_call!
connect ax25 /usr/sbin/netrom_call bbs gb7djk g1tlh
'Connect' '' 
'Connect' 'c np7'
'Connect' 'c gb7dxm'
# you can leave this out if you call the script 'gb7dxm'
client gb7dxm ax25
</verb></tscreen>

<P>

<tscreen><verb>
timeout 60
abort (Busy|Sorry|Fail)
# this does exactly the same as the previous example
# the '1' is the AGW port number to connect thru for g1tlh
connect agw 1 g1tlh
'Connect' '' 
'Connect' 'c np7'
'Connect' 'c gb7dxm'
# you can leave this out if you call the script 'gb7dxm'
client gb7dxm ax25
</verb></tscreen>

<P>

<tscreen><verb>
timeout 15
connect telnet dirkl.tobit.co.uk
'login' 'gb7djk'
'word' 'gb7djk'
# tell GB7DJK-1 that it is connected to GB7DJK
# you can leave this out if you call this script 'gb7djk'
client gb7djk telnet
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
Both these examples assume that everything is set up properly at the other end.  
You will find other examples in the /spider/examples directory.

<sect1>Starting the connection

<P>
You start the connection, from within a sysop enabled cluster login, by typing 
in the word <em>connect</em> followed by a script name like this ....

<tscreen><verb>
G0VGS de GB7MBC 13-Dec-1998 2041Z >connect gb7djk-1
connection to GB7DJK-1 started
G0VGS de GB7MBC 13-Dec-1998 2043Z >
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
This will start a connection using the script called <em>gb7djk-1</em>.  You can
follow the connection by watching the term or console from where you started
<em>cluster.pl</em>.  From version 1.47 onwards, you will need to <tt>set/debug connect</tt> first.
You should see something like this ...

<tscreen><verb>
<- D G1TLH connect gb7djk-1
-> D G1TLH connection to GB7DJK-1 started
-> D G1TLH G1TLH de GB7DJK 13-Dec-1998 2046Z >

    etc

</verb></tscreen>

<P>
With later versions of Spider there is a set/login command for users.  This 
tells them when a user or node logs in or out.  If you do not add a line to 
your scripts after the final line (or before the client line which should always 
be last if needed) then the login/logout information will be sent to users
<it>before</it> the login actually completes.  This means if a node is 
unreachable, it will continue sending logins and logouts to users even though it 
is not actually connecting.  To avoid this use the following line ...

<tscreen><verb>
'connect' ''
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
In a script, this might look like ...

<tscreen><verb>
timeout 35 
abort (Busy|Sorry|Fail)
connect telnet mary 3000
'ogin:' 'gb7mbc'
'>' 'telnet 44.131.93.96 7305'
'connect' ''
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Telnet echo

<P>
Cluster links in particular suffer greatly from the presence of telnet echo.  
This is caused by the telnet negotiation itself and can create at worst severe 
loops.  At best it creates unnecessary bandwidth and large logfiles!  There are
things that can be done to limit this problem but will not always work dependent 
on the route taken to connect.

<P>
Telnet echo itself should only be a problem if the connection is being made to 
the telnet port (23).  This port uses special rules that include echo negotiation.
If the connection is to a different port, such as 7300, this negotiation does 
not happen and therefore no echo should be present.

<P>
Sometimes it is not possible to make a direct connection to another node and this 
can cause problems.  There is a way of trying to suppress the telnet echo but 
this will not always work, unfortunately it is difficult to be more specific.  
Here is an example of what I mean ...

<tscreen><verb>
timeout 35
abort (Busy|Sorry|Fail)
connect telnet mary.lancs.ac.uk
'ogin:' 'gb7mbc'
'word:' 'mypasswd'
'\$' 'stty -echo raw'
'\$' 'telnet 44.131.93.96'
'connect' ''
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
So, the first connection is made by Spider.  This is fine as Spider uses the
Net_Telnet script from within perl.  This actually uses TCP rather than TELNET 
so no negotiation will be done on the first connection.  Once connected to
mary.lancs.ac.uk, the command is sent to suppress echo.  Now a telnet is made 
to a cluster node that is accepting connections on port 23.  The problem with 
this link is that the negotiation is made by the remote machine, therefore you 
have no control over it.  The chances are that this link will create echo and 
there will be no way you can stop it.


<sect1>Autostarting the cluster

<P>
Ok, you should now have DXSpider running nicely and allowing connects by cluster
nodes or users.  However, it has to be shutdown and restarted manually.  It
would be much easier to have it start automatically. 

<P>
This is not only a way to start the cluster automatically, it also works as a
watchdog, checking the sanity of DXSpider and respawning it should it crash for 
any reason.  Before doing the following, shutdown the cluster as you did earlier.

<P>
Login as root and bring up the /etc/inittab file in your favourite editor.  Add 
the following lines to the file near the end ...

<tscreen><verb>
##Start DXSpider on bootup and respawn it should it crash
DX:3:respawn:/bin/su -c "/usr/bin/perl -w /spider/perl/cluster.pl" sysop >/dev/tty7
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
This line works fine for RedHat distributions. It is also fine for SuSE up to
7.0.  From SuSE 7.1 you need to add runlevels 2 and 5 like this ...

<tscreen><verb>
DX:235:respawn:/bin/su -c "/usr/bin/perl -w /spider/perl/cluster.pl" sysop >/dev/tty7
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
The line required for Slackware distributions is slightly different.  My thanks to 
Aurelio, PA3EZL for this information.

<tscreen><verb>
DX:23:respawn:/bin/su - sysop -c "/usr/bin/perl -w /spider/perl/cluster.pl" >/dev/tty7
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
This will automatically start DXSpider on tty7 (ALT-F7) on bootup and restart 
it should it crash for any reason.

<P>
NB: It should be noted that /dev/tty7 is only an example.  Some SuSE systems will
only accept upto tty6.  It really does not matter which tty you run it on.

<P>
As root type the command <em>telinit q</em>.  DXSpider should start up 
immediately.  You will see the output on tty7 and if you login as <em>sysop</em> 
you should find everything running nicely.

<sect>Microsoft Windows Installation

<sect1>Introduction

<P>
<bf>IMPORTANT:</bf> 

What you'll be left with once you've followed these instructions
is (hopefully) a working DX Spider v1.50 system that is capable
of accepting or originating "internet" connections, plus inbound
and outbound AX.25 and TCP/IP radio connections.

On the other hand, you may have an enquiring mind, or better yet,
may be looking for a useful way of connecting your current
(perhaps) AK1A cluster "to the internet" via some networking
mechanism (BPQEther, etc) or other. I won't be producing
instructions for the latter case, because I don't have an AK1A to
play with. But someone might ...

Whatever, this document is intended to get you started with DX
Spider in a Microsoft Windows &trade; environment. It's not
intended to teach you anything other than how to perform a
minimum configuration of a DX Spider installation and have it
able to connect across "the internet" to other DX Clusters, while
accepting inbound TELNET and radio connections.

<sect1>The requirements

<P>
The very first things you're going to need are (in order of
importance):-

<itemize>
<item>A cup of good, strong tea
<item>A supported Windows platform with an internet connection so you can
download the necessary software bits and bobs directly to it. There are other ways, but this is preferable.
<item>Another cup of good, strong tea
<item>If all goes according to plan, about an hour to spare
<item>Plenty of good, strong tea
</itemize>

<sect1>The system

<P>
The platform I used to generate these instructions was a
"vanilla" Microsoft Windows Me 4.90.3000 system, with a 700MHz
AMD Athlon processor and 96 Mb memory. I've also personally
verified that it runs on my laptop (Pentium 266MHz, 32 Mb memory,
Windows 98 SE v4.10.2222 A) and a computer that I assembled from
a random pile of junk (AMD K6-2 333MHz, 64 Mb memory, Windows 98
v4.10.1998). As a result, I have reason to believe that what I'm
about to describe will perform equally on any 32-bit MS Windows
environment with 32 Mb of memory.

Because of the changes that have recently been made to the core
"cluster.pl" module and the introduction of a very lightweight
"winclient.pl", I have a sneaking suspicion that this will now
run on any platform that has reasonably complete support for
Perl. Is there someone out there with both an enquiring mind and
(say) a Macintosh, for instance?

Please bear in mind, though, that my instructions relate solely
to how to get this going under a Microsoft Windows environment,
and I have zero intention of trying to make them say otherwise.

<sect1>Perl

<P>
Install your chosen Perl environment. Unless you have a very good
reason for not doing so, I strongly suggest that you use
ActivePerl v5.6. For my testing & development, I used build 623.
(A recent installation used the newer ActivePerl v5.6.1, build
633 without any noticable difficulty.)  You can get this from:
<htmlurl url="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/Download.html"
name="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/Download.html">

The link takes you to an initial page of System Requirements and
Software Prerequisites.  If you do not have it already installed, 
you can download and install the Windows Installer 2.0 for a Win98
installation.  Be forewarned, you will have to reboot your PC at the
completion of the installer's installation.  

If you already have the installer on your PC, simply click on the 
Next arrow at the bottom of the page.  Two clicks will finally get
you to the actual download page.  The MSI version of Build 633 is 
now 8.6MB in size, so make that a big cup of tea or coffee if you're
on a slow dial-up connection.

During installation, please ensure that you do choose the options
to "Add Perl to the PATH environment variable" and "Create Perl
file extension association"; it will make your life so much
easier. Once the installation is finished, be sure to reboot your
PC. You probably won't be told anywhere else that this needs to
be done now, but it does. Really.

Once you've rebooted, open a "DOS box" (Start > Run > command
might do it, if you can't find it elsewhere) and from wherever it
lands, type PERL -v &lt;ENTER&gt; (it's better if that's a lower-case
'v', because an upper-case 'V' means something else. You should
be rewarded with some interesting information about your Perl
installation. If you're not, you must go back to the beginning
and discover what went wrong and fix it. It's pointless to
proceed unless this simple check is passed. Assuming it did work,
you may now move on.

<sect1>Additional packages

<P>
Some extensions ("packages") need to be added to the base Perl
distribution, and we'll do this next. If you're using the Perl I
recommended, and don't know any better for yourself, then just
blindly following these instructions will work just fine. If that
didn't describe you, then you're on your own.

Visit the following URL:

<htmlurl url="http://www.activestate.com/PPMPackages/zips/6xx-builds-only/"
name="http://www.activestate.com/PPMPackages/zips/6xx-builds-only/">

and download the following files:-

<tscreen><verb>
Data-Dumper.zip
Net-Telnet.zip
TimeDate.zip
Time-HiRes.zip
DB_File.zip
</verb></tscreen>

If this is a new installation, now would also be a good time to 
install a copy of WinZip on your PC.  Make yourself a convenient 
directory to unpack all of these zip files into (I put mine in 
"D:\ppm>" but "C:\ppm" works just as well.) and do the following 
(the bits you type in are blue ).  You can upzip all of the files into
the same directory.  When prompted, simply overwrite the Readme file 
from each zip package.  Note that where these files land will be 
directly related to where you chose to install your ActivePerl 
(mine, as you can probably guess from what follows, went into "D:\Perl"):-

<tscreen><verb>
D:\ppm>ppm install Data-Dumper.ppd
Installing package 'Data-Dumper.ppd'
Installing D:\Perl\site\lib\auto\Data\Dumper\Dumper.bs
Installing D:\Perl\site\lib\auto\Data\Dumper\Dumper.dll
Installing D:\Perl\site\lib\auto\Data\Dumper\Dumper.exp
Installing D:\Perl\site\lib\auto\Data\Dumper\Dumper.lib
Installing D:\Perl\html\site\lib\auto\Data\Dumper\Dumper.html
Installing D:\Perl\site\lib\Data\Dumper\Dumper.pm
Writing D:\Perl\site\lib\auto\Data\Dumper\Dumper.packlist
D:\ppm>
</verb></tscreen>

I'm not going to bother you with exhaustive details of the rest
of them, but suffice it to say you need to:

<tscreen><verb>
ppm install DB_File.ppd
ppm install Net-Telnet.ppd
ppm install TimeDate.ppd
ppm install Time-HiRes.ppd
</verb></tscreen>

If all that seemed to work OK, time to move along. Before anyone
who is familiar with PPM tells me that we didn't need to download
and keep those files locally, I knew that. I also knew that PPM
is sometimes awkward to configure via firewalls, and that
sometimes the repositories don't always work the way we'd hope. I
do it that way because it suits me.

<sect1>Getting Spider

<P>
Get the current version of the DX Spider distribution. This needs
to be v1.50 or later. You've got two ways (currently) of getting
this; either get a CVS update from sourceforge (if you don't know
what this is, then it isn't for you) or get the latest "official"
release from:

<htmlurl url="http://www.dxcluster.org/download/index.html" name="http://www.dxcluster.org/download/index.html">

or if you want the lastest snapshot of CVS version (which is produced 
every night):-

<htmlurl url="http://www.dxcluster.org/download/CVSlatest.tgz" name="http://www.dxcluster.org/download/CVSlatest.tgz">

This is generally the best one to go for as it is completely up to
date. However, there is always the very slight chance that it might
unstable. Generally, there will be a note on the website if this is 
the case. 


The only difference between "CVSlatest.tgz" and the latest
"official" release version is that it is more up to date. <bf>Do not confuse 
the "CVSlatest.tgz" file with "Downloading from Sourceforge with CVS" - they
are two quite different things.</bf>  "Downloading from Sourceforge with CVS" is
explained in a section within the Admin manual.

<p>
If you go down the CVS route (ie installing WinCVS as explained in the Admin
manual and downloaded from sourceforge), then everything will be nicely
installed on your local disk. If you got the CVSlatest.tgz file, unzip 
(<htmlurl url="http://www.winzip.com" name="winzip">) it to "C:\".  
This is an important point since paths are included within the .tgz 
file.  Make sure you unzip to the root directory of whichever drive you use...
"C:\" or "D:\" or .., not "C:\spider."  If you double click on CVSlatest.tgz, 
WinZip should open with a dialogue box that says the Archive contains a single
file (CVSlatest.tar) and asks whether WinZip should decompress it to a 
temporary fold and then open it.  Say "Yes" and then you will get the typical 
Classical WinZip listing of files ready for extraction.  Remember, extract 
them to your desired root directory ("C:\" or "D:\" or ...).  The following 
examples assume that you put it on drive "C:\", for convenience.

<sect>Installing the software

<P>
At this point you will need to create 2 additional directories under 
"C:\Spider."  Make directories "C:\spider\local" and "C:\spider\local_cmd". 
If "C:\spider" is missing, go back and figure out why, because it shouldn't be.

Now create your own local copy of the DXVars.pm file by:-

<tscreen><verb>
copy c:\spider\perl\DXVars.pm.issue
c:\spider\local\DXVars.pm
</verb></tscreen>

Now you'll need to edit this file using a text editor like Notepad. If nothing
else, you can simply

<tscreen><verb>
cd \spider\local
</verb></tscreen>

and then

<tscreen><verb>
notepad DXVars.pm
</verb></tscreen>

to bring up an editor window containing the file. As an absolute
minimum you must adjust the following items in DXVars.pm:-

<itemize>
<item> $mycall  - Should hold the callsign of your DX Cluster
<item> $myname  - The SysOp's first name
<item> $myalias - the SysOp's callsign. Cannot be the same as $mycall!
<item> $myqth - The station's geographical location (QTH).
<item> $mylatitude - The station latitude in degrees and decimal fractions
<item> $mylongitude - The station longitude in degrees and decimal fractions
<item> $mylocator - The Maidenhead (or QRA) locator of the station 
</itemize>

You really also ought to update the $myqth and $myemail variables. And
unless you are absolutely certain you know what you're doing, you
should change nothing else in this file. Note that if you use an "@" or 
a "$" character in one of the above strings (typically in $myemail) you must 
write them as "\@" or "\$". 

<sect1>Incoming telnets

<P>
If you want to enable inbound "TELNET" connections (or you are running
Windows 98, NT, 2000 or XP), you've got a little more work to do. From a
handy "DOS box" that's not doing anything else, do the following:-

<tscreen><verb>
copy \spider\perl\Listeners.pm \spider\local
cd \spider\local
notepad listeners.pm
</verb></tscreen>

The following line need attention:-

<tscreen><verb>
#               ["0.0.0.0", 7300],
</verb></tscreen>

On my machine, I've simply uncommented the "0.0.0.0" entry by
removing the '#' from the front of the line. 

<bf>You MUST carry out this step if you are
running on a Windows 98, NT, 2000 or XP based system</bf>

If you don't have a static hostname for your machine, and you
intend to allow folk to connect to your machine across the
internet, then I'd suggest you pay a visit to www.dyndns.org and
create one for yourself. While it's free, it will take a modest
amount of effort on your part to read, understand and
implement what needs to be done to set this up.

<p>If your machine is connected to the internet <bf>and</bf> you don't
want to allow your machine to be visible to the outside world you
should change the "0.0.0.0" to "127.0.0.1" [which is
"localhost"]. This will then only allow connections from inside your
machine. As was said earlier: if you aren't running Win9x (or you want
to use DXTelnet or somesuch), then you need to have the machine
listening at least to "127.0.0.1" ("0.0.0.0" means <bf>all</bf> IP
addresses).

<sect1>The AGW packet engine

<P>
On the assumption that you'll be using the SV2AGW Packet Engine
to interface your radios to the cluster, it would be a good idea to
download the Packet Engine software!  You can get this software from:

<htmlurl url="http://www.raag.org/sv2agw/agwpe.zip" name="http://www.raag.org/sv2agw/agwpe.zip">

Depending upon your TNCs, you may also need to get:

<htmlurl url="http://www.raag.org/sv2agw/drivers.zip" name="http://www.raag.org/sv2agw/drivers.zip">

A couple of the tools:

<htmlurl url="http://www.raag.org/sv2agw/agwterm.zip" name="http://www.raag.org/sv2agw/agwterm.zip">

<htmlurl url="http://www.raag.org/sv2agw/agwmonitor.zip" name="http://www.raag.org/sv2agw/agwmonitor.zip">

will also help with troubleshooting of the RF links themselves.

Install and configure AGWPE.  You should now create your own local copy of 
AGWConnect.pm by:-

<tscreen><verb>
copy c:\spider\perl\AGWConnect.pm
c:\spider\local\AGWConnect.pm
</verb></tscreen>

and then

<tscreen><verb>
notepad AGWConnect.pm
</verb></tscreen>

to bring up an editor window containing the file. You must
consider adjusting the following items in AGWConnect.pm:-

<itemize>
<item>$enable - set to '1' to enable AGWPE interface 
<item>$login  - the login ID you chose when you set up the SV2AGW security :-)
<item>$passwd - password that matches $login
</itemize>

The login ID and passwd only need to be set if you are accessing AGW separately
via its web interface.  This interface is normally not needed for use with DXSpider.

<sect1>Setting up the initial user files

<P>
Next you need to create the initial user files, etc. A tool is
supplied which will do this for you. To run the tool:-

<tscreen><verb>
cd \spider\perl
perl create_sysop.pl
</verb></tscreen>

If all goes according to plan, you will see no output from this
program, and after a brief wait, your DOS prompt will be
returned.

Depending on how brave you are, you might now care to try the
following:-

<tscreen><verb>
perl cluster.pl
</verb></tscreen>

If you did everything you were told, your DOS window will now
hold a display which looks something like:-

<tscreen><verb>
DXSpider DX Cluster Version 1.50

</verb></tscreen>

Now, if that's what you've got, you are very nearly home and dry
(in as far as these particular experiments are concerned, anyhow)

If you are running Windows 9x you can access your new cluster (from
the local machine) by finding yourself another "DOS box" and doing the
following:-

<tscreen><verb>
cd \spider\perl
perl winclient.pl
</verb></tscreen>

If you are running Windows NT, 2000 or XP then winclient.pl does not
work. We don't know why other than this seems to be some kind of
incomaptibility in perl. You can achieve the same thing by telnetting
to the port you defined in Listeners.pm (7300 as default), thus:-

<tscreen><verb>
Menu->Start->Run
telnet localhost 7300
</verb></tscreen>

On getting the <bf>login:</bf> prompt, enter your sysop callsign (the one you
put in DXVars.pm as $myalias).

<p>I would recommend <bf>strongly</bf> that you obtain a better telnet
client than that which comes with windows (I use <htmlurl
url="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html"
name="PuTTY">). 

<p>Anyway, if you are rewarded with a display which looks something like:-

<tscreen><verb>
Hello Iain, this is GB7SJP in Amersham, Bucks running DXSpider V1.50
Cluster: 1 nodes, 1 local / 1 total users Max users 2 Uptime 0 00:00
M0ADI de GB7SJP 4-Mar-2001 1511Z >
</verb></tscreen>

You've arrived. Try some commands, and see how they feel. (In
case you were wondering, "Iain", "M0ADI" and "GB7SJP" all came
from the version of DXVars.pm that was on the machine when I
started the winclient.pl)

<p>The interface is very basic. It is a simple command line. There are
better looking interfaces. Most of the "standard" logging and DX
Cluster access programs that are capable of connecting via a TCP or
telnet connection will work as a "Sysop Console" client. You connect
to "localhost" on the port that you defined in Listeners.pm (usually
7300). I recommend packages like <htmlurl
url="http://www.qsl.net/wd4ngb/telnet.htm" name="DXTelnet">.

<sect1>Connecting to other clusters

<P>
If you want to connect this to another cluster, then you'll want to
negotiate a link with someone. For experimental purposes, I'm happy to
allow folk to connect to GB7DXA (spud.ath.cx), on the understanding
that the system may or may not be there and may or may not be
connected to anything particularly useful at any given moment. Contact
me by <htmlurl url="mailto:g0rdi@blacksheep.org" name="Email"> if you
want me to set up a connection for you.

<sect>General Information

<P>
The following relates to all versions of DXSpider and is not platform related.

<sect1>The crontab file

<P>
Login as <em>sysop</em> and create a file in /spider/local_cmd called crontab.  
Edit it with your favourite editor and add a line like this (I have included 
a comment)

<tscreen><verb>
# check every 10 minutes to see if gb7xxx is connected and if not
# start a connect job going

0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * start_connect('gb7xxx') unless connected('gb7xxx')
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
The callsign involved will be the callsign of the cluster node you are 
going to connect to.  This will now check every 10 minutes to see if 
gb7xxx is connected, if it is then nothing will be done.  If it is not, 
then a connect attempt will be started.

<P>
There are probably lots of other things you could use this crontab file for.  
If you want to know more about it, look at the
<htmlurl url="http://www.dxcluster.org/cron.html" name="DXSpider"> website 
at the cron page where it is explained more fully.
