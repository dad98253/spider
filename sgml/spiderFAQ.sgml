<sect>Installation 

<sect1>Where do I get DXSpider?

<P>
All things Spider can be found at <htmlurl url="http://www.dxcluster.org" name="www.dxcluster.org"> and the actual program and patches can be found in the <htmlurl url="http://www.dxcluster.org/download/index.html" name="download"> area.

<sect1>How do I use the patches?

<P>
Patching is done in the standard linux way ...

<tscreen><verb>
zcat /tmp/patch-1.40 | patch -p0
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
assuming the patch version you are using is 1.40 and resides in /tmp!

<P>
Be aware that each patch assumes the previous patch has been applied.  That
is to say if you are patching from version 1.38 to 1.40 you would first need
to apply patch-1.39 and then patch-1.40.

<sect1>If I use a tarball to overwrite my installation, what happens to my configuration?

<P>
The tarballs are designed to not overwrite your existing configuration
and can be used at any time to update your Spider software.  All the key
files have the suffix .issue (eg. DXVars.pm.issue) at default.

<sect1>I am running RedHat 5.2 and I am getting strange errors, what is wrong?

<P>
The version of Perl that comes with 5.2 seems to be some kind of pre-release
and is broken.  You can get a new version of perl from 
<htmlurl url="http://www.dxcluster.org/download/index.html" name="www.dxcluster.org"> 
or <htmlurl url="ftp://updates.redhat.com" name="ftp://updates.redhat.com">.  
Don't forget to patch it with the CPAN modules.

<sect>Administration

<sect1>How can I get Spider to restart automatically if it crashes?

<P>
Put this line into /etc/inittab ..

<tscreen><verb>
DX:3:respawn:/bin/su -c "/usr/bin/perl -w /spider/perl/cluster.pl" sysop > /dev/tty7
</verb></tscreen>

Run <em>telinit q</em> as root.  Spider will restart so be aware.  However, any
time you reboot, cluster.pl will start in tty7 and if it crashes, it should restart ok.

<sect1>How can I monitor traffic to and from a node or user?

<P>
There are 2 ways to achieve this.  You can use the <em>tail</em> command like this ..

<tscreen><verb>
tail -f /spider/data/debug/167.dat |grep G0VGS
</verb></tscreen>

or in later versions of Spider, there is a command called <em>watchdbg</em> in which
case you simply type ..

<tscreen><verb>
watchdbg G0VGS
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>My neighbouring node cannot use the RCMD command to me, he just keeps 
getting the "tut tut" message.

<P>
Assuming that the permissions are set correctly (perm level 5 required), it could be
that the home_node is set incorrectly.  You can reset the home_node using the <em>spoof</em>
command like this ..

<tscreen><verb>
spoof gb7adx set/home gb7adx
</verb></tscreen>

Assuming that the node_call you are changing is gb7adx.

<sect1>I do not seem to be sending any bulletin mail to my link partners, what is wrong?

<P>
There is a file in /spider/msg called forward.pl.issue.  Rename this to
forward.pl and edit it to meet your requirements.  You will need to issue
the command <em>load/forward</em> or restart Spider for the changes to 
take effect.
