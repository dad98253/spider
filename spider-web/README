Spider-WEB v0.6b

Completely based on a clx web client written in Java by dl6dbh
(ftp://clx.muc.de/pub/clx/clx-java_10130001.tgz)

The webserver has to run on the same machine as your DxSpider software!

It is assumed that you have Java installed.  You need JDK1.3.1 at least.

Installation instructions (Performed as root):

Put all the files in the spider-web directory into a newly created directory
under the DocumentRoot of your websever for instance 'client'. In my case
this is:  /home/httpd/html/client/ although ymmv.  For Suse the correct
path should be /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/client/ for example.

Move spider.cgi to the cgi-bin directory of your webserver, in my case that is
/home/httpd/cgi-bin/ although ymmv.  For Suse the correct path should be
/usr/local/httpd/cgi-bin/ for example.

Change the permissions of the files to ensure they are correct, obviously you
will need to use the correct path the the files according to your system:

chmod 755 /home/httpd/html/cgi-bin/spider.cgi
chmod -R 755 /home/httpd/html/client/

By default the spider.cgi script should pick up your hostname (As long as this
is set correctly).  If it does not or your hostname differs from the name that
you attach to the public address that you are using, then edit spider.cgi :

# Uncomment and set the hostname manually here if the above fails.
# $HOSTNAME = "gb7mbc.spoo.org" ;
$PORT = "8000" ;

'HOSTNAME' is the hostname of your cluster.

'PORT' is the portnumber that you use to connect to your DxSpider via
telnet (see Listeners.pm)

NOTE: If you can start the console but cannot connect to the cluster from it, 
then it is possible that the machine you are on cannot resolve the hostname of 
your cluster machine.  If this is the case, you need to set your hostname 
manually as above.

You also need to set the $NODECALL variable.  This prints the name of your
choosing (probably your cluster callsign) on the html page.

You now can connect to Spider-Web via http://yourserver/cgi-bin/spider.cgi
