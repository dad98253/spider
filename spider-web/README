Spider-WEB v0.6b

Completely based on a clx web client written in Java by dl6dbh
(ftp://clx.muc.de/pub/clx/clx-java_10130001.tgz)

The webserver has to run on the same machine as your DxSpider software!

Installation instructions:

Put all the files in the spider-web directory into a newly created directory
under the documentroot of your websever for instance 'client'. In my case
this is:
/usr/local/httpd/spider/client/

================================================================
!NOTE! this directory has to be writeable by your http daemon!!!!
=================================================================

move spider.cgi to the cgi-bin directory of your webserver, in my case that is
/usr/local/httpd/cgi-bin/ 
make it worldreadable.

edit spider.cgi and change  the following parameters:

portnumber=$"1407"
tempdir=$"/usr/local/httpd/spider/client/"
clustercall=$"PA4AB-15"

'portnumber' is the portnumber that you use to connect to your DxSpider via
telnet (see Listeners.pm)

'tempdir' is the directory that you just created and that you used to move
the *.java and *.class files to.

'clustercall' is the call of your cluster.

You now can connect to Spider-Web via http://yourserver/cgi-bin/spider.cgi
