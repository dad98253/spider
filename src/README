The C client

Eventually this client will do everything that the standard C client does
but, for the moment, it does the following:-

  * replaces client.pl on INCOMING connections for ax25 and telnet
  * provides a LOCAL connection on a console or xterm

In order to use this client you must:-
  
  1. Compile it (type 'make').
  2. Change the entries in /etc/ax25/ax25d.conf referencing client.pl
     from:

[ether]
NOCALL   * * * * * *  L
default  * * * * * *  - spider /spider/perl/client.pl client.pl %u ax25

     to:

[ether]
NOCALL   * * * * * *  L
default  * * * * * *  - spider /spider/src/client client %u ax25

  3. Send ax25d a HUP signal ('killall -HUP ax25d').

Please let me know how it performs:-
