  11..  IInnssttaallllaattiioonn ((OOrriiggiinnaall vveerrssiioonn bbyy IIaaiinn PPhhiilliippppss,, GG00RRDDII))

  11..11..  IInnttrroodduuccttiioonn

  This section describes the installation of DX Spider v1.46 on a RedHat
  Linux Distribution.  Wherever possible I will try to include
  differences for other distributions.  I do not intend to try and cover
  the installation of Linux or the setup of the AX25 utilities.  If you
  need help on this then read Iains original installation guide that
  comes with the Spider distribution.


  I am assuming a general knowledge of Linux and its commands.  You
  should know how to use _t_a_r and how to edit files using your favourite
  editor.


  The crucial ingredient for all of this is Perl.  Earlier versions of
  Spider required perl 5.004, however it is now _S_T_R_O_N_G_L_Y recommended
  that you use at least version 5.005_03 as this is the version being
  used in the development of Spider.


  In addition to the standard Red Hat distribution you will require the
  following modules from http://www.cpan.org/CPAN.html ...



  +o  MD5-1.7.tar.gz

  +o  Data-Dumper-2.10.tar.gz

  +o  TimeDate-1.08.tar.gz

  +o  IO-1.20.tar.gz

  +o  Net-Telnet-3.02.tar.gz

  +o  Curses-1.05.tar.gz

  +o  Time-HiRes-01.20.tar.gz



  _D_o get the latest versions of these packages and install them but use
  the above list as the earliest versions usable.


  11..22..  PPrreeppaarraattiioonn

  I will assume that you have already downloaded the latest tarball of
  the DXSpider software and are ready to install it. I am assuming
  version 1.46 for this section but of course you would use the latest
  version.


  Login as root and create a user to run the cluster under.  _U_N_D_E_R _N_O
  _C_I_R_C_U_M_S_T_A_N_C_E_S _U_S_E _R_O_O_T _A_S _T_H_I_S _U_S_E_R_!.  I am going to use the name
  _s_y_s_o_p.  You can call it anything you wish.  Depending on your security
  requirements you may wish to use an existing user, however this is
  your own choice.




       # adduser -m sysop





  Now set a password for the user ...



       # passwd sysop
       # New UNIX password:
       # Retype new UNIX password:
       passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully





  11..33..  IInnssttaalllliinngg tthhee ssooffttwwaarree

  Now to unpack the DX Spider distribution, set symbolic links and group
  permissions.  Copy the tarball to /home/sysop and do the following.



       # cd ~sysop
       # tar xvfz spider-1.46.tar.gz
       # ln -s ~sysop/spider /spider
       # groupadd -g 251 spider       (or another number)




  If you do not have the command _g_r_o_u_p_a_d_d available to you simply add a
  line in /etc/group by hand.



       # vi /etc/group                (or your favorite editor)

  You also need to add some others to the group, including your own
  callsign (this will be used as an alias) and root.  The finished line
  in /etc/group should look something like this

  spider:x:251:sysop,g0vgs,root


  The next step is to set the permissions on the Spider directory tree
  and files ....



       # chown -R sysop.spider spider
       # find . -type d -exec chmod 2775 {} \;
       # find . -type f -exec chmod 775 {} \;





  This last step allows various users of the group _s_p_i_d_e_r to have write
  access to all the directories.  This is not really needed just yet but
  will be useful when web interfaces start to appear.


  Finally, you need to fix the permissions on the ax25_call and
  netrom_call programs.  Check where they are with the _l_o_c_a_t_e command
  and alter the permissions with the _c_h_m_o_d command like this ..



       # chown root ax25_call netrom_call
       # chmod 4775 ax25_call netrom_call





  11..44..  SSeettttiinngg ccaallllssiiggnnss eettcc

  Now login to your machine as the user you created earlier.  In my case
  that user is called _s_y_s_o_p.  Once logged in, issue the following
  commands ....



       $ cd /spider
       $ mkdir local
       $ mkdir local_cmd
       $ cp perl/DXVars.pm.issue local/DXVars.pm
       $ cd local
       $ vi DXVars.pm (or your favourite editor)





  Using the distributed DXVars.pm as a a template, set your cluster
  callsign, sysop callsign and other user info to suit your own
  environment. Note that this a perl file which will be parsed and
  executed as part of the cluster. If you get it wrong then perl will
  complain when you start the cluster process.  It is important only to
  alter the text of any section.  Some of the lines look a little odd.
  Take this line for example ....


  $myemail = "ianmaude\@btinternet.com";


  There appears to be an extra slash in there.  However this has to be
  there for the file to work so leave it in.


  PPLLEEAASSEE UUSSEE CCAAPPIITTAALL LLEETTTTEERRSS FFOORR CCAALLLLSSIIGGNNSS


  DON'T alter any file in /spider/perl, they are overwritten with every
  release. Any files or commands you place in /spider/local or
  /spider/local_cmd will automagically be used in preference to the ones
  in /spider/perl EVEN while the cluster is running!


  Save the new file and change directory to ../perl ....



       $ cd ../perl





  Now type the following command which creates the basic user file with
  you as the sysop.



       $ ./create_sysop.pl





  11..55..  SSttaarrttiinngg uupp ffoorr tthhee ffiirrsstt ttiimmee

  We can now bring spider up for the first time and see if all is well
  or not!  It should look something like this ...



       $ ./cluster.pl
       DXSpider DX Cluster Version 1.46
       Copyright (c) 1998 Dirk Koopman G1TLH
       loading prefixes ...
       loading band data ...
       loading user file system ...
       starting listener ...
       reading existing message headers
       reading cron jobs
       orft we jolly well go ...





  If all is well then login on another term or console as _s_y_s_o_p and cd
  to /spider/perl.  Now issue the following command ...



       $ ./client.pl

  This should log you into the cluster as the sysop under the alias
  callsign we set earlier.  In this case the callsign is G0VGS.  The
  cluster callsign is set in the DXVars.pm file in /spider/local.  In
  this case we will assume that this was set as GB7MBC.  You should
  therefore see this when you login ....



       G0VGS de GB7MBC 19-Nov-1999 2150Z >




  If you do, congratulations!  If not, look over the instructions again,
  you have probably missed something out.  You can shut spider down
  again with the command ....



       shutdown





  and both the cluster and the client should return to Linux prompts.


  22..  TThhee CClliieenntt pprrooggrraamm

  In earlier versions of Spider, all the processes were Perl scripts.
  This was fine but with a lot of users your computer memory would soon
  be used up.  To combat this a new client was written in "C".  This
  client only works for _i_n_c_o_m_i_n_g connects at the moment.  Before you can
  use it though it has to be "made".  CD to /spider/src and type _m_a_k_e.
  You should see the output on your screen and hopefully now have a
  small C program called _c_l_i_e_n_t.  Leave it in this directory.

  As stated previously, the aim of this document is not to tell you how
  to configure Linux or the ax25 utilities.  However, you do need to add
  a line in your ax25d.conf to allow connections to DXSpider for your
  users.  For each interface that you wish to allow connections on, use
  the following format ...



       default  * * * * * *  - sysop /spider/src/client client %u ax25




  or, if you wish your users to be able to use SSID's on their callsigns
  ..



       default  * * * * * *  - sysop /spider/src/client client %s ax25

  Allowing telnet connections is quite simple.  Firstly you need to add
  a line in /etc/services to allow connections to a port number, like
  this ....



       spdlogin   8000/tcp     # spider anonymous login port




  Then add a line in /etc/inetd.conf like this ....



       spdlogin stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /spider/src/client login telnet





  This needs to be added above the standard services such as ftp, telnet
  etc.  Once this is done, you need to restart inetd like this ....



       killall -HUP inetd






  Now login as _s_y_s_o_p and cd spider/perl. You can test that spider is
  accepting telnet logins by issuing the following command ....



       ./client.pl login telnet




  You should get a login prompt and on issuing a callsign, you will be
  given access to the cluster.  Note, you will not get a password login.
  There seems no good reason for a password prompt to be given so it is
  not asked for.


  Assuming all is well, then try a telnet from your linux console ....



       telnet localhost 8000





  You should now get the login prompt and be able to login as before.




  33..33..  SSeettttiinngg uupp nnooddee ccoonnnneeccttss

  In order to allow cluster node connections, spider needs to know that
  the connecting callsign is a cluster node.  This is the case whether
  the connect is incoming or outgoing.  In spider this is a simple task
  and can be done in runtime.


  Later versions of Spider can distinguish different software and treat
  them differently.  For example, the WCY beacon cannot be handles by
  AK1A type nodes as AK1A does not know what to do with PC73.  There are
  4 different types of node at present and although they may not have
  any major differences at the moment, it allows for compatibility.  The
  4 types are ...



       set/node        (AK1A type)
       set/spider
       set/dxnet
       set/clx





  For now, we will assume that the cluster we are going to connect to is
  an AK1A type node.


  Start up the cluster as you did before and login as the sysop with
  client.pl.  The cluster node I am wanting to make a connection to is
  GB7BAA but you would obviously use whatever callsign you required.  At
  the prompt type ...



       set/node gb7baa





  The case does not matter as long as you have a version of DXSpider
  later than 1.33.  Earlier versions required the callsign to be in
  upper case.


  That is now set, it is as simple as that.  To prove it, login on yet
  another console as sysop, cd to spider/perl and issue the command ...



       ./client.pl gb7baa (using the callsign you set as a node)





  You should get an initialisation string from DXSpider like this ...



       ./client.pl gb7baa
       PC38^GB7MBC^~

  If the callsign you just set up as a cluster node is for an incoming
  connect, this is all that needs to be done.  If the connection is to
  be outgoing then a connection script needs to be written.


  33..44..  CCoonnnneeccttiioonn ssccrriippttss

  Because DXSpider operates under Linux, connections can be made using
  just about any protocol;  AX25, NETRom, tcp/ip, ROSE etc are all
  possible examples.  Connect scripts live in the /spider/connect
  directory and are simple ascii files.  Writing a script for
  connections is therefore relatively simple.


  The connect scripts consist of lines which start with the following
  keywords or symbols:-



  #               All lines starting with a # are ignored, as are completely
                  blank lines.

  timeout         timeout followed by a number is the number of seconds to wait for a
                  command to complete. If there is no timeout specified in the script
                  then the default is 60 seconds.

  abort           abort is a regular expression containing one or more strings to look
                  for to abort a connection. This is a perl regular expression and is
                  executed ignoring case.

  connect         connect followed by ax25 or telnet and some type dependent
                  information. In the case of a telnet connection, there can be up to
                  two parameters.
                  The first is the ip address or hostname of the computer you wish to
                  connect to and the second is the port number you want to use (this
                  can be left out if it is a normal telnet session).
                  In the case of an ax25 session then this would normally be a call to
                  ax25_call or netrom_call as in the example above. It is your
                  responsibility to get your node and other ax25 parameters to work
                  before going down this route!

  '               line in a chat type script. The words/phrases normally come in pairs,
                  either can be empty. Each line reads input from the connection until
                  it sees the string (or perl regular expression) contained in the
                  left hand string. If the left hand string is empty then it doesn't
                  read or wait for anything. The comparison is done ignoring case.
                  When the left hand string has found what it is looking for (if it is)
                  then the right hand string is sent to the connection.
                  This process is repeated for every line of chat script.

  client          client starts the connection, put the arguments you would want here
                  if you were starting the client program manually. You only need this
                  if the script has a different name to the callsign you are trying to
                  connect to (i.e. you have a script called other which actually
                  connects to GB7DJK-1 [instead of a script called gb7djk-1]).




  There are many possible ways to configure the script but here are two
  examples, one for a NETRom/AX25 connect and one for tcp/ip.





  timeout 60
  abort (Busy|Sorry|Fail)
  # don't forget to chmod 4775 netrom_call!
  connect ax25 /usr/sbin/netrom_call bbs gb7djk g1tlh
  # you can leave this out if you call the script 'gb7dxm'
  client gb7dxm ax25








       timeout 15
       connect telnet dirkl.tobit.co.uk
       # tell GB7DJK-1 that it is connected to GB7DJK
       # you can leave this out if you call this script 'gb7djk'
       client gb7djk telnet





  Both these examples assume that everything is set up properly at the
  other end.  You will find other examples in the /spider/examples
  directory.


  33..55..  SSttaarrttiinngg tthhee ccoonnnneeccttiioonn

  You start the connection, from within a sysop enabled cluster login,
  by typing in the word _c_o_n_n_e_c_t followed by a script name like this ....



       G0VGS de GB7MBC 13-Dec-1998 2041Z >connect gb7djk-1
       connection to GB7DJK-1 started
       G0VGS de GB7MBC 13-Dec-1998 2043Z >




  This will start a connection using the script called _g_b_7_d_j_k_-_1.  You
  can follow the connection by watching the term or console from where
  you started _c_l_u_s_t_e_r_._p_l.  You should see something like this ...

      etc





  With later versions of Spider there is a set/login command for users.
  This tells them when a user or node logs in or out.  If you do not add
  a line to your scripts after the final line (or before the client line
  which should always be last if needed) then the login/logout
  information will be sent to users _b_e_f_o_r_e the login actually completes.
  This means if a node is unreachable, it will continue sending logins
  and logouts to users even though it is not actually connecting.  To
  avoid this use the following line ...








  In a script, this might look like ...



       timeout 35
       abort (Busy|Sorry|Fail)
       connect telnet mary 3000





  33..66..  TTeellnneett eecchhoo

  Cluster links in particular suffer greatly from the presence of telnet
  echo.  This is caused by the telnet negotiation itself and can create
  at worst severe loops.  At best it creates unnecessary bandwidth and
  large logfiles!  There are things that can be done to limit this
  problem but will not always work dependent on the route taken to
  connect.


  Telnet echo itself should only be a problem if the connection is being
  made to the telnet port (23).  This port uses special rules that
  include echo negotiation.  If the connection is to a different port,
  such as 8000, this negotiation does not happen and therefore no echo
  should be present.


  Sometimes it is not possible to make a direct connection to another
  node and this can cause problems.  There is a way of trying to
  suppress the telnet echo but this will not always work, unfortunately
  it is difficult to be more specific.  Here is an example of what I
  mean ...



       timeout 35
       abort (Busy|Sorry|Fail)
       connect telnet mary.lancs.ac.uk




  So, the first connection is made by Spider.  This is fine as Spider
  uses the Net_Telnet script from within perl.  This actually uses TCP
  rather than TELNET so no negotiation will be done on the first
  connection.  Once connected to mary.lancs.ac.uk, the command is sent
  to suppress echo.  Now a telnet is made to a cluster node that is
  accepting connections on port 23.  The problem with this link is that
  the negotiation is made by the remote machine, therefore you have no
  control over it.  The chances are that this link will create echo and
  there will be no way you can stop it.

  Ok, you should now have DXSpider running nicely and allowing connects
  by cluster nodes or users.  However, it has to be shutdown and
  restarted manually and if connection scripts fail they have to be
  started again manually too, not much use if you are not at the
  console!  So, in this section we will automate both.  Firstly starting
  the cluster.


  44..11..  AAuuttoossttaarrttiinngg tthhee cclluusstteerr

  This is not only a way to start the cluster automatically, it also
  works as a watchdog, checking the sanity of DXSpider and respawning it
  should it crash for any reason.  Before doing the following, shutdown
  the cluster as you did earlier.


  Login as root and bring up the /etc/inittab file in your favourite
  editor.  Add the following lines to the file near the end ...



       ##Start DXSpider on bootup and respawn it should it crash
       DX:3:respawn:/bin/su -c "/usr/bin/perl -w /spider/perl/cluster.pl" sysop >/dev/tty7




  This line works fine for RedHat distributions. It is also fine for
  SuSE up to 7.0.  From Suse 7.1 you need to add runlevels 2 and 5 like
  this ...



       DX:235:respawn:/bin/su -c "/usr/bin/perl -w /spider/perl/cluster.pl" sysop >/dev/tty7





  The line required for Slackware distributions is slightly different.
  My thanks to Aurelio, PA3EZL for this information.



       DX:23:respawn:/bin/su - sysop -c "/usr/bin/perl -w /spider/perl/cluster.pl" >/dev/tty7





  This will automatically start DXSpider on tty7 (ALT-F7) on bootup and
  restart it should it crash for any reason.


  As root type the command _t_e_l_i_n_i_t _q.  DXSpider should start up
  immediately.  You will see the output on tty7 and if you login as
  _s_y_s_o_p you should find everything running nicely.


  So far so good, now to automate script connections...


  44..22..  TThhee ccrroonnttaabb ffiillee

  Login as _s_y_s_o_p and create a file in /spider/local_cmd called crontab.
  Edit it with your favourite editor and add a line like this (I have
  included a comment)



       # check every 10 minutes to see if gb7xxx is connected and if not
       # start a connect job going

       0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * start_connect('gb7xxx') if !connected('gb7xxx')





  The callsign involved will be the callsign of the cluster node you are
  going to connect to.  This will now check every 10 minutes to see if
  gb7xxx is connected, if it is then nothing will be done.  If it is
  not, then a connect attempt will be started.


  There are probably lots of other things you could use this crontab
  file for.  If you want to know more about it, look at the DXSpider
  website at the cron page where it is explained more fully.





  55..  HHoopp ccoonnttrrooll

  Starting with version 1.13 there is simple hop control available on a
  per node basis. Also it is possible to isolate a network completely so
  that you get all the benefits of being on that network, but can't pass
  on information from it to any other networks you may be connected to
  (or vice versa).


  55..11..  BBaassiicc hhoopp ccoonnttrrooll

  In /spider/data you will find a file called hop_table.pl.  This is the
  file that controls your hop count settings.  It has a set of default
  hops on the various PC frames and also a set for each node you want to
  alter the hops for.  You may be happy with the default settings of
  course, but this powerful tool can help to protect and improve the
  network.  The file will look something like this ...

















































  #
  # hop table construction
  #

  package DXProt;

  # default hopcount to use
  $def_hopcount = 5;

  # some variable hop counts based on message type
  %hopcount =
  (
   11 => 10,
   16 => 10,
   17 => 10,
   19 => 10,
   21 => 10,
  );


  # the per node hop control thingy


  %nodehops =

   GB7ADX => {            11 => 8,
                          12 => 8,
                          16 => 8,
                          17 => 8,
                          19 => 8,
                          21 => 8,
                     },

   GB7UDX => {            11 => 8,
                          12 => 8,
                          16 => 8,
                          17 => 8,
                          19 => 8,
                          21 => 8,
                     },
   GB7BAA => {
                          11 => 5,
                          12 => 8,
                          16 => 8,
                          17 => 8,
                          19 => 8,
                          21 => 8,
                     },
  };





  Each set of hops is contained within a pair of curly braces and
  contains a series of PC frame types.  PC11 for example is a DX spot.
  The figures here are not exhaustive but should give you a good idea of
  how the file works.


  You can alter this file at any time, including whilst the cluster is
  running.  If you alter the file during runtime, the command _l_o_a_d_/_h_o_p_s
  will bring your changes into effect.



  55..22..  IIssoollaattiinngg nneettwwoorrkkss

  It is possible to isolate networks from each other on a "gateway" node
  using the _s_e_t_/_i_s_o_l_a_t_e _<_n_o_d_e___c_a_l_l_> command.


  The effect of this is to partition an isolated network completely from
  another nodes connected to your node. Your node will appear on and
  otherwise behave normally on every network to which you are connected,
  but data from an isolated network will not cross onto any other
  network or vice versa. However all the spot, announce and WWV traffic
  and personal messages will still be handled locally (because you are a
  real node on all connected networks), that is locally connected users
  will appear on all networks and will be able to access and receive
  information from all networks transparently.  All routed messages will
  be sent as normal, so if a user on one network knows that you are a
  gateway for another network, he can still still send a talk/announce
  etc message via your node and it will be routed across.


  The only limitation currently is that non-private messages cannot be
  passed down isolated links regardless of whether they are generated
  locally. This will change when the bulletin routing facility is added.


  If you use isolate on a node connection you will continue to receive
  all information from the isolated partner, however you will not pass
  any information back to the isolated node.  There are times when you
  would like to forward only spots across a link (maybe during a contest
  for example).  To do this, isolate the node in the normal way and put
  in a filter in the /spider/filter/spots directory to override the
  isolate.  This filter can be very simple and consists of just one line
  ....



       $in = [
               [ 1, 0, 'd', 0, 3]      # The last figure (3) is the hop count
       ];





  There is a lot more on filtering in the next section.


  66..  FFiilltteerriinngg ((OOlldd SSttyyllee uuppttoo vv11..4444))

  Filters can be set for spots, announcements and WWV.  You will find
  the directories for these under /spider/filter.  You will find some
  examples in the directories with the suffix _._i_s_s_u_e.  There are two
  types of filter, one for incoming information and one for outgoing
  information.  Outgoing filters are in the form _C_A_L_L_S_I_G_N_._p_l and
  incoming filters are in the form _i_n___C_A_L_L_S_I_G_N_._p_l.  Filters can be set
  for both nodes and users.


  All filters work in basically the same way.  There are several
  elements delimited by commas.  There can be many lines in the filter
  and they are read from the top by the program.  When writing a filter
  you need to think carefully about just what you want to achieve.  You
  are either going to write a filter to _a_c_c_e_p_t or to _r_e_j_e_c_t.  Think of a
  filter as having 2 main elements.  For a reject filter, you would have
  a line or multiple lines rejecting the things you do not wish to
  receive and then a default line accepting everything else that is not
  included in the filter.  Likewise, for an accept filter, you would
  have a line or multiple lines accepting the things you wish to receive
  and a default line rejecting everthing else.


  In the example below, a user requires a filter that would only return
  SSB spots posted in Europe on the HF bands.  This is achieved by first
  rejecting the CW section of each HF band and rejecting all of VHF, UHF
  etc based on frequency.  Secondly, a filter rule is set based on CQ
  zones to only accept spots posted in Europe.  Lastly, a default filter
  rule is set to reject anything outside the filter.



       $in = [
               [ 0, 0, 'r', # reject all CW spots
                       [
                       1800.0, 1850.0,
                       3500.0, 3600.0,
                       7000.0, 7040.0,
                       14000.0, 14100.0,
                       18068.0, 18110.0,
                       21000.0, 21150.0,
                       24890.0, 24930.0,
                       28000.0, 28180.0,
                       30000.0, 49000000000.0,
                       ] ,1 ],
               [ 1, 11, 'n', [ 14, 15, 16, 20, 33, ], 15 ], #accept EU
               [ 0, 0, 'd', 0, 1 ], # 1 = want, 'd' = everything else
       ];





  The actual elements of each filter are described more fully in the
  following sections.


  66..11..  SSppoottss

  The elements of the Spot filter are ....



       [action, field_no, sort, possible_values, hops]





  There are 3 elements here to look at.  Firstly, the action element.
  This is very simple and only 2 possible states exist, accept (1) or
  drop (0).


  The second element is the field_no.  There are 13 possiblities to
  choose from here ....








        0 = frequency
        1 = call
        2 = date in unix format
        3 = comment
        4 = spotter
        5 = spotted dxcc country
        6 = spotter's dxcc country
        7 = origin
        8 = spotted itu
        9 = spotted cq
        10 = spotter's itu
        11 = spotter's cq
        12 = callsign of the channel on which the spot has appeared





  The third element tells us what to expect in the fourth element.
  There are 4 possibilities ....



            n - numeric list of numbers e.g. [ 1,2,3 ]
            r - ranges of pairs of numbers e.g. between 2 and 4 or 10 to 17 - [ 2,4, 10,17 ]
            a - an alphanumeric regex
            d - the default rule





  The fifth element is simply the hops to set in this filter.  This
  would only be used if the filter was for a node of course and
  overrides the hop count in hop_table.pl.


  So, let's look at an example spot filter.  It does not matter in the
  example who the filter is to be used for.  So, what do we need in the
  filter?  We need to filter the spots the user/node requires and also
  set a default rule for anything else outside the filter.  Below is a
  simple filter that stops spots arriving from outside Europe.



       $in = [
         [ 0, 4, 'a', '^(K|N|A|W|VE|VA|J)'],  # 0 = drop, 'a' = alphanumeric
         [ 1, 0, 'd', 0, 1 ],                 # 1 = want, 'd' = everything else
                            ];





  So the filter is wrapped in between a pair of square brackets.  This
  tells Spider to look in between these limits.  Then each line is
  contained within its own square brackets and ends with a comma. Lets
  look carefully at the first line.  The first element is 0 (drop).
  Therefore anything we put on this line will not be accepted.  The next
  element is 4.  This means we are filtering by the spotter.  The third
  element is the letter "a" which tells the program to expect an
  alphanumeric expression in the fourth element.  The fourth element is
  a list of letters separated by the pipe symbol.



  What this line does is tell the program to drop any spots posted by
  anyone in the USA, Canada or Japan.


  The second line is the default rule for anything else.  The "d" tells
  us this and the line simply reads... accept anything else.


  You can add as many lines as you need to complete the filter but if
  there are several lines of the same type it is neater to enclose them
  all as one line.  An example of this is where specific bands are set.
  We could write this like this ....



       [ 0,0,'r',[1800.0, 2000.0], 1],
       [ 0,0,'r',[10100.0, 10150.0], 1],
       [ 0,0,'r',[14000.0, 14350.0], 1],
       [ 0,0,'r',[18000.0, 18200.0], 1],





  But the line below achieves the same thing and is more efficient ....



         [ 0, 0, 'r',
           [
             1800.0, 2000.0,         # top band
             10100.0, 10150.0,       # WARC
             14000.0, 14350.0,       # 20m
             18000.0, 18200.0,       # WARC
           [ ,1 ],






  66..22..  AAnnnnoouunncceemmeennttss




       # This is an example announce or filter allowing only West EU announces
       #
       # The element list is:-
       # 0 - callsign of announcer
       # 1 - destination * = all, <callsign> = routed to the node
       # 2 - text
       # 3 - * - sysop, <some text> - special list eg 6MUK, ' ', normal announce
       # 4 - origin
       # 5 - 0 - announce, 1 - wx
       # 6 - channel callsign (the interface from which this spot came)

       $in = [
               [ 1, 0, 'a', '^(P[ABCDE]|DK0WCY|G|M|2|EI|F|ON)' ],
               [ 0, 0, 'd', 0 ]
       ];





  In this example, only the prefixes listed will be allowed.  It is
  possible to be quite specific.  The Dutch prefix "P" is followed by
  several secondary identifiers which are allowed.  So, in the example,
  "PA" or "PE" would be ok but not "PG".  It is even possible to allow
  information from a single callsign.  In the example this is DK0WCY, to
  allow the posting of his Aurora Beacon.


  66..33..  WWWWVV




       # This is an example WWV filter
       #
       # The element list is:-
       # 0 - nominal unix date of spot (ie the day + hour:13)
       # 1 - the hour
       # 2 - SFI
       # 3 - K
       # 4 - I
       # 5 - text
       # 6 - spotter
       # 7 - origin
       # 8 - incoming interface callsign

       # this one doesn't filter, it just sets the hop count to 6 and is
       # used mainly just to override any isolation from WWV coming from
       # the internet.

       $in = [
               [ 1, 0, 'd', 0, 6 ]
       ];





  It should be noted that the filter will start to be used only once a
  user/node has logged out and back in again.

  I am not going to spend any more time on these filters now as they
  will become more "comprehensive" in the near future.

  Upto v1.44 it was not possible for the user to set their own filters.
  From v1.45 though that has all changed.  It is now possible to set
  filters for just about anything you wish.  If you have just updated
  from an older version of DXSpider you will need to update your new
  filters.  You do not need to do anything with your old filters, they
  will be renamed as you update.


  There are 3 basic commands involved in setting and manipulating
  filters.  These are _a_c_c_e_p_t, _r_e_j_e_c_t and _c_l_e_a_r.  First we will look
  generally at filtering. There are a number of things you can filter in
  the DXSpider system. They all use the same general mechanism.


  In general terms you can create a 'reject' or an 'accept' filter which
  can have up to 10 lines in it. You do this using, for example ...

       accept/spots .....
       reject/spots .....




  where ..... are the specific commands for that type of filter. There
  are filters for spots, wwv, announce, wcy and (for sysops) connects.
  See each different accept or reject command reference for more
  details.

  There is also a command to clear out one or more lines in a filter.
  They are ...



       clear/spots 1
       clear/spots all




  There is clear/xxxx command for each type of filter.


  and you can check that your filters have worked by the command ...




       show/filter





  For now we are going to use spots for the examples, but you can apply
  the same principles to all types of filter.


  77..22..  TTyyppeess ooff ffiilltteerr

  There are two main types of filter, _a_c_c_e_p_t or _r_e_j_e_c_t.  You can use
  either to achieve the result you want dependent on your own preference
  and which is more simple to do.  It is pointless writing 8 lines of
  reject filters when 1 accept filter would do the same thing!  Each
  filter has 10 lines (of any length) which are tried in order.  If a
  line matches then the action you have specified is taken (ie reject
  means ignore it and accept means take it)


  If you specify reject filters, then any lines that arrive that match
  the filter will be dumped but all else will be accepted.  If you use
  an accept filter, then ONLY the lines in the filter will be accepted
  and all else will be dumped.  For example if you have a single line
  _a_c_c_e_p_t filter ...



       accept/spots on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)




  then you will _O_N_L_Y get VHF spots _f_r_o_m or _t_o CQ zones 14, 15 and 16.

  If you set a reject filter like this ...



       reject/spots on hf/cw




  Then you will get everything _E_X_C_E_P_T HF CW spots.  You could make this
  single filter even more flexible.  For example, if you are interested
  in IOTA and will work it even on CW even though normally you are not
  interested in CW, then you could say ...



       reject/spots on hf/cw and not info iota




  But in that case you might only be interested in iota and say:-



       accept/spots not on hf/cw or info iota




  which achieves exactly the same thing. You should choose one or the
  other until you are comfortable with the way it works. You can mix
  them if you wish (actually you can have an accept AND a reject on the
  same line) but don't attempt this until you are sure you know what you
  are doing!


  You can arrange your filter lines into logical units, either for your
  own understanding or simply convenience. Here is an example ...



       reject/spots 1 on hf/cw
       reject/spots 2 on 50000/1400000 not (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)




  What this does is to ignore all HF CW spots and also rejects any spots
  on VHF which don't either originate or spot someone in Europe.


  This is an example where you would use a line number (1 and 2 in this
  case), if you leave the digit out, the system assumes '1'. Digits
  '0'-'9' are available.  This make it easier to see just what filters
  you have set.  It also makes it more simple to remove individual
  filters, during a contest for example.


  You will notice in the above example that the second line has
  brackets.  Look at the line logically.  You can see there are 2
  separate sections to it.  We are saying reject spots that are VHF or
  above _A_P_A_R_T from those in zones 14, 15 and 16 (either spotted there or
  originated there).  If you did not have the brackets to separate the 2
  sections, then Spider would read it logically from the front and see a
  different expression entirely ...
       (on 50000/1400000 and by_zone 14,15,16) or call_zone 14,15,16




  The simple way to remember this is, if you use OR - use brackets.
  Whilst we are here CASE is not important. 'And BY_Zone' is just the
  same as 'and by_zone'.

  As mentioned earlier, setting several filters can be more flexible
  than simply setting one complex one.  Doing it in this way means that
  if you want to alter your filter you can just redefine or remove one
  or more lines of it or one line. For example ...



       reject/spots 1 on hf/ssb




  would redefine our earlier example, or



       clear/spots 1




  To remove all the filter lines in the spot filter ...



       clear/spots all





  77..33..  FFiilltteerr ooppttiioonnss

  You can filter in several different ways.  The options are listed in
  the various helpfiles for accept, reject and filter.


  77..44..  DDeeffaauulltt ffiilltteerrss

  Sometimes all that is needed is a general rule for node connects.
  This can be done with a node_default filter.  This rule will always be
  followed, even if the link is isolated, unless another filter is set
  specifically.  Default rules can be set for nodes and users.  They can
  be set for spots, announces, WWV and WCY.  They can also be used for
  hops.  An example might look like this ...



       accept/spot node_default by_zone 14,15,16,20,33
       set/hops node_default spot 50




  This filter is for spots only, you could set others for announce, WWV
  and WCY.  This filter would work for ALL nodes unless a specific
  filter is written to override it for a particular node.  You can also
  set a user_default should you require.  It is important to note that
  default filters should be considered to be "connected".  By this I
  mean that should you override the default filter for spots, you need
  to add a rule for the hops for spots also.


  77..55..  AAddvvaanncceedd ffiilltteerriinngg

  Once you are happy with the results you get, you may like to
  experiment.


  The previous example that filters hf/cw spots and accepts vhf/uhf
  spots from EU can be written with a mixed filter, for example ...



       rej/spot on hf/cw
       acc/spot on 0/30000
       acc/spot 2 on 50000/1400000 and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)




  Note that the first filter has not been specified with a number.  This
  will automatically be assumed to be number 1.  In this case, we have
  said _r_e_j_e_c_t _a_l_l _H_F _s_p_o_t_s _i_n _t_h_e _C_W _s_e_c_t_i_o_n _o_f _t_h_e _b_a_n_d_s _b_u_t _a_c_c_e_p_t _a_l_l
  _o_t_h_e_r_s _a_t _H_F_.  _A_l_s_o _a_c_c_e_p_t _a_n_y_t_h_i_n_g _i_n _V_H_F _a_n_d _a_b_o_v_e _s_p_o_t_t_e_d _i_n _o_r _b_y
  _o_p_e_r_a_t_o_r_s _i_n _t_h_e _z_o_n_e_s _1_4_, _1_5 _a_n_d _1_6.  Each filter slot actually has a
  'reject' slot and an 'accept' slot. The reject slot is executed BEFORE
  the accept slot.


  It was mentioned earlier that after a reject test that doesn't match,
  the default for following tests is 'accept', the reverse is true for
  'accept'. In the example what happens is that the reject is executed
  first, any non hf/cw spot is passed to the accept line, which lets
  through everything else on HF.  The next filter line lets through just
  VHF/UHF spots from EU.

  In the /spider/msg directory you will find a file called
  badmsg.pl.issue.  Rename this to badmsg.pl and edit the file.  The
  original looks something like this ....

















  # the list of regexes for messages that we won't store having
  # received them (bear in mind that we must receive them fully before
  # we can bin them)


  # The format of each line is as follows

  # source: T - to field, F - from field,  O - origin, S - subject
  # pattern: a perl regex on the field requested

  # Currently only type B and P msgs are affected by this code.
  #
  # The list is read from the top down, the first pattern that matches
  # causes the action to be taken.

  # The pattern can be undef or 0 in which case it will always be selected
  # for the action specified



  package DXMsg;

  @badmsg = (
  );





  I think this is fairly self explanatory.  It is simply a list of
  subject headers that we do not want to pass on to either the users of
  the cluster or the other cluster nodes that we are linked to.  This is
  usually because of rules and regulations pertaining to items for sale
  etc in a particular country.

  In the same way as mail, there are some types of spot we do not wish
  to pass on to users or linked cluster nodes.  In the /spider/data
  directory you will find a file called baddx.pl.issue.  Rename this to
  baddx.pl and edit the file.  The original looks like this ....

















  # the list of dx spot addresses that we don't store and don't pass on


  package DXProt;

  @baddx = qw

   FROG
   SALE
   FORSALE
   WANTED
   P1RATE
   PIRATE
   TEST
   DXTEST
   NIL
   NOCALL
  );





  Again, this is simply a list of names we do not want to see in the
  spotted field of a DX callout.

  Create a file in /spider/data called _b_a_d_w_o_r_d_s.  The format is quite
  simple.  Lines beginning with # are ignored so comments can be added.
  An example file is below ...



       # Below is a list of words we do not wish to see on the cluster
       grunge grunged grunging
       splodge splodger splodging
       grince
       fluffle




  Multiple words can be used on the same line as shown.  Obviously these
  are just examples :-)


  You can reload the file from the cluster prompt as sysop with
  load/badwords.


  99..  MMaaiill

  DXSpider deals seamlessly with standard AK1A type mail.  It supports
  both personal and bulletin mail and the sysop has additional commands
  to ensure that mail gets to where it is meant.  DXSpider will send
  mail almost immediately, assuming that the target is on line.
  However, only one mail message is dealt with at any one time.  If a
  mail message is already being sent or recieved, then the new message
  will be queued until it has finished.

  The cluster mail is automatically deleted after 30 days unless the
  sysop sets the "keep" flag using the _m_s_g command.

  99..11..  PPeerrssoonnaall mmaaiill

  Personal mail is sent using the _s_p command.  This is actually the
  default method of sending mail and so a simple _s for send will do.  A
  full list of the send commands and options is in the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d _s_e_t
  section, so I will not duplicate them here.


  99..22..  BBuulllleettiinn mmaaiill

  Bulletin mail is sent by using the _s_b command.  This is one of the
  most common mistakes users make when sending mail.  They send a
  bulletin mail with _s or _s_p instead of _s_b and of course the message
  never leaves the cluster.  This can be rectified by the sysop by using
  the _m_s_g command.


  Bulletin addresses can be set using the Forward.pl file.


  99..33..  FFoorrwwaarrdd..ppll

  DXSpider receives all and any mail sent to it without any alterations
  needed in files.  Because personal and bulletin mail are treated
  differently, there is no need for a list of accepted bulletin
  addresses.  It is necessary, however, to tell the program which links
  accept which bulletins.  For example, it is pointless sending
  bulletins addresses to "UK" to any links other than UK ones.  The file
  that does this is called forward.pl and lives in /spider/msg.  At
  default, like other spider files it is named forward.pl.issue.  Rename
  it to forward.pl and edit the file to match your requirements.  The
  format is below ...


































  #
  # this is an example message forwarding file for the system
  #
  # The format of each line is as follows
  #
  #     type    to/from/at pattern action  destinations
  #     P/B/F     T/F/A     regex   I/F    [ call [, call ...] ]
  #
  # type: P - private, B - bulletin (msg), F - file (ak1a bull)
  # to/from/at: T - to field, F - from field, A - home bbs, O - origin
  # pattern: a perl regex on the field requested
  # action: I - ignore, F - forward
  # destinations: a reference to an array containing node callsigns
  #
  # if it is non-private and isn't in here then it won't get forwarded
  #
  # Currently only type B msgs are affected by this code.
  #
  # The list is read from the top down, the first pattern that matches
  # causes the action to be taken.
  #
  # The pattern can be undef or 0 in which case it will always be selected
  # for the action specified
  #
  # If the BBS list is undef or 0 and the action is 'F' (and it matches the
  # pattern) then it will always be forwarded to every node that doesn't have
  # it (I strongly recommend you don't use this unless you REALLY mean it, if
  # you allow a new link with this on EVERY bull will be forwarded immediately
  # on first connection)
  #

  package DXMsg;

  @forward = (
  );




  Simply insert a bulletin address and state in the brackets where you
  wish that mail to go.  For example, you can see here that mail sent to
  "UK" will only be sent to the UK links and not to PA4AB-14.


  To force the cluster to reread the file use load/forward



  99..44..  TThhee mmssgg ccoommmmaanndd

  The _m_s_g command is a very powerful and flexible tool for the sysop.
  It allows the sysop to alter to and from fields and make other changes
  to manage the cluster mail.

  Here is a full list of the various options ...











    MSG TO <msgno> <call>     - change TO callsign to <call>
    MSG FRom <msgno> <call>   - change FROM callsign to <call>
    MSG PRrivate <msgno>      - set private flag
    MSG NOPRrivate <msgno>    - unset private flag
    MSG RR <msgno>            - set RR flag
    MSG NORR <msgno>          - unset RR flag
    MSG KEep <msgno>          - set the keep flag (message won't be deleted ever)
    MSG NOKEep <msgno>        - unset the keep flag
    MSG SUbject <msgno> <new> - change the subject to <new>
    MSG WAittime <msgno>      - remove any waiting time for this message
    MSG NOREad <msgno>        - mark message as unread
    MSG REad <msgno>          - mark message as read
    MSG QUeue                 - queue any outstanding bulletins
    MSG QUeue 1               - queue any outstanding private messages




  These commands are simply typed from within the cluster as the sysop
  user.


  99..55..  MMeessssaaggee ssttaattuuss

  You can check on a message from within the cluster by using the
  command _s_t_a_t_/_m_s_g.  This will give you additional information on the
  message number including which nodes have received it, which node it
  was received from and when etc.  Here is an example of the output of
  the command ...

  Distribution lists are simply a list of users to send certain types of
  mail to.  An example of this is mail you only wish to send to other
  sysops.  In /spider/msg there is a directory called _d_i_s_t_r_o.  You put
  any distibution lists in here.  For example, here is a file called
  SYSOP.pl that caters for the UK sysops.


       qw(GB7TLH GB7DJK GB7DXM GB7CDX GB7BPQ GB7DXN GB7MBC GB7MBC-6 GB7MDX
          GB7NDX GB7SDX GB7TDX GB7UDX GB7YDX GB7ADX GB7BAA GB7DXA GB7DXH
          GB7DXK GB7DXI GB7DXS)




  Any mail sent to "sysop" would only be sent to the callsigns in this
  list.


  99..88..  BBBBSS iinntteerrffaaccee

  Spider provides a simple BBS interface.  No input is required from the
  sysop of the cluster at all.  The BBS simply sets the cluster as a BBS
  and pushes any required mail to the cluster.  No mail can flow from
  Spider to the BBS, the interface is one-way.


  Please be careful not to flood the cluster network with unnecessary
  mail.  Make sure you only send mail to the clusters that want it by
  using the Forward.pl file very carefully.


  1100..  DDaattaabbaasseess

  Spider allows the creation of local or remote databases.  It supports
  chained databases, allowing several different databases to be scanned
  with one simple command.  Importing of databases is limited at present
  to the standard AK1A databases such as OBLAST and the DB0SDX QSL
  database but will expand with time.


  1100..11..  CCrreeaattiinngg ddaattaabbaasseess

  Creating a database could not be more simple.  All the commands are
  sent from the cluster prompt as the _s_y_s_o_p user.

  To create a database you use the command _d_b_c_r_e_a_t_e.  It can be used in
  3 different ways like so ..



       dbcreate <name>




  To simply create a database locally, you just tell the command the
  name of the database.  This does not create the actual database, it
  simply defines it to say that it exists.



       dbcreate <name> chain <name> [<name>...]




  This creates a chained database entry.  The first database will be
  scanned, then the second, the third etc...



       dbcreate <name> remote <name>

  This creates a remote entry.  the first name field is the database
  name at the remote node, then the remote switch, then the actual
  node_call of the remote node, for example...



       dbcreate buckmaster remote gb7dxc




  Remote databases cannot be chained, however, the last database in a
  chain can be a remote database.


  1100..22..  IImmppoorrttiinngg ddaattaabbaasseess

  The only databases that Spider can currently import are the standard
  AK1A databases such as OBLAST or the DB0SDX qsl and address database.
  This will be added to with time.

  To import such a database, first put the file somewhere useful like
  /tmp and then issue the following command ...



       dbimport oblast /tmp/OBLAST.FUL




  This will update the existing local oblast database or create it if it
  does not exist.

  Once a database is created, you will want to check that it has been
  added.  To do this use the _d_b_a_v_a_i_l command.  This will output the
  available databases.  For example ...



       dbavail
       DB Name          Location   Chain
       qsl              Local
       buck             GB7ADX

  To look for information in a defined database, simply use the _d_b_s_h_o_w
  command, for example ...



       dbshow buckmaster G0YLM




  will show the information for the callsign G0YLM from the buckmaster
  database if it exists.  To make things more standard for the users you
  can add an entry in the Aliases file so that it looks like a standard
  _s_h_o_w command like this ...







  Now you can simply use show/buckmaster or an abreviation.


  1100..55..  RReemmoovviinngg ddaattaabbaasseess

  To delete an existing database you use the _d_b_r_e_m_o_v_e command.  For
  example ...



       dbremove oblast




  would remove the oblast database and its associated datafile from the
  system.  There are no warnings or recovery possible from this command.
  If you remove a database it ceases to exist and would have to be
  created from scratch if you still required it.

  1111..11..  MMOOTTDD

  One of the more important things a cluster sysop needs to do is to get
  information to his users.  The simplest way to do this is to have a
  banner that is sent to the user on login.  This is know as a "message
  of the day" or "motd".  To set this up, simply create a file in
  /spider/data called motd and edit it to say whatever you want.  It is
  purely a text file and will be sent automatically to anyone logging in
  to the cluster.


  1111..22..  DDoowwnnttiimmee mmeessssaaggee

  If for any reason the cluster is down, maybe for upgrade or
  maintenance but the machine is still running, a message can be sent to
  the user advising them of the fact.  This message lives in the
  /spider/data directory and is called "offline".  Simply create the
  file and edit it to say whatever you wish.  This file will be sent to
  a user attempting to log into the cluster when DXSpider is not
  actually running.


  1111..33..  OOtthheerr tteexxtt mmeessssaaggeess

  You can set other text messages to be read by the user if they input
  the file name.  This could be for news items or maybe information for
  new users.  To set this up, make a directory under /spider called
  _p_a_c_k_c_l_u_s.  Under this directory you can create files called _n_e_w_s or
  _n_e_w_u_s_e_r for example.  In fact you can create files with any names you
  like.  These can be listed by the user with the command ....


       show/files




  They can be read by the user by typing the command ....



       type news




  If the file they want to read is called _n_e_w_s.  You could also set an
  alias for this in the Alias file to allow them just to type _n_e_w_s


  You can also store other information in this directory, either
  directly or nested under directories.  One use for this would be to
  store DX bulletins such as the OPDX bulletins.  These can be listed
  and read by the user.  To keep things tidy, make a directory under
  /spider/packclus called _b_u_l_l_e_t_i_n_s.  Now copy any OPDX or similar
  bulletins into it.  These can be listed by the user in the same way as
  above using the _s_h_o_w_/_f_i_l_e_s command with an extension for the bulletins
  directory you have just created, like this ....



       show/files bulletins





  An example would look like this ....



       sh/files
       bulletins      DIR 20-Dec-1999 1715Z news          1602 14-Dec-1999 1330Z




  You can see that in the files area (basically the packclus directory)
  there is a file called _n_e_w_s and a directory called _b_u_l_l_e_t_i_n_s.  You can
  also see that dates they were created.  In the case of the file _n_e_w_s,
  you can also see the time it was last modified, a good clue as to
  whether the file has been updated since you last read it.  To read the
  file called _n_e_w_s you would simply issue the command ....



       type news




  To look what is in the bulletins directory you issue the command ....






  show/files bulletins

  You will find a file in /spider/cmd/ called Aliases.  First, copy this
  file to /spider/local_cmd/Aliases and edit this file.  You will see
  something like this ...

















  #!/usr/bin/perl

  # provide some standard aliases for commands for terminally
  # helpless ak1a user (helpless in the sense that they never
  # read nor understand help files)

  # This file is automagically reloaded if its modification time is
  # later than the one stored in CmdAlias.pm

  # PLEASE make this file consistant with reality! (the patterns MUST
  # match the filenames!)

  # Don't alter this file, copy it into the local_cmd tree and modify it.
  # This file will be replaced everytime I issue a new release.

  # You only need to put aliases in here for commands that don't work as
  # you desire naturally, e.g sh/dx on its own just works as you expect

  You can create aliases for commands at will.  Beware though, these may
  not always turn out as you think.  Care is needed and you need to test
  the results once you have set an alias.


  1111..55..  CCoonnssoollee..ppll

  In later versions of Spider a simple console program is provided for
  the sysop.  This has a type ahead buffer with line editing facilities
  and colour for spots, announces etc.  To use this program, simply use
  console.pl instead of client.pl.


  To edit the colours, copy /spider/perl/Console.pl to /spider/local and
  edit the file with your favourite editor.

  Spider has a powerful and flexible show/satellite command.  In order
  for this to be accurate, the kepler data has to be updated regularly.
  In general, this data is available as an email or via cluster mail.
  Updating it is simple.  First you need to export the mail message as a
  file.  You do this with the _e_x_p_o_r_t command from the cluster prompt as
  the sysop.  For example ...



       export 5467 /spider/perl/keps.in




  would export message number 5467 as a file called keps.in in the
  /spider/perl directory.

  Now login to a VT as sysop and cd /spider/perl.  There is a command in
  the perl directory called _c_o_n_v_k_e_p_s_._p_l.  All we need to do now is
  convert the file like so ...



       ./convkeps.pl keps.in




  Now go back to the cluster and issue the command ...



       load/keps




  That is it!  the kepler data has been updated.

  The command _s_h_/_q_r_z will only work once you have followed a few simple
  steps.  First you need to get a user ID and password from qrz.com.
  Simply go to the site and create one.  Secondly you need to copy the
  file /spider/perl/Internet.pm to /spider/local and alter it to match
  your user ID and password.  You also at this point need to set
  $allow=1 to complete the setup.  Many thanks to Fred Lloyd, the
  proprieter of qrz.com for allowing this access.


  1122..  CCVVSS

  CVS stands for "Concurrent Versions System" and the CVS for DXSpider
  is held at Sourceforge.  This means that it is possible to update your
  DXSpider installation to the latest sources by using a few simple
  commands.


  THIS IS NOT FOR THE FAINT HEARTED!!!  ONLY DO THIS IF YOU HAVE A TEST
  INSTALLATION OR ARE WILLING TO HAVE YOUR CLUSTER CRASH ON YOU!!!  THIS
  MUST BE CONSIDERED AT LEAST BETA TESTING AND MAYBE EVEN ALPHA!!  YOU
  HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!


  DID I MENTION..... ONLY DO THIS IF YOU ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT THE
  CONSEQUENCES!!!


  I am of course assuming that you have a machine with both DXSpider and
  Internet access running.


  BEFORE YOU EVEN CONSIDER STARTING WITH THIS MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR
  ENTIRE SPIDER TREE!!


  Assuming you are connected to the Internet, you need to login to the
  CVS repository and then update your Spider source.  There are several
  steps which are listed below ...


  First login as the user _s_y_s_o_p.  Next you need to connect to the CVS
  repository.  You do this with the command below ...


  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.DXSpider.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dxspider login



  You will get a password prompt.  Simply hit return here and your
  machine should return to a normal linux prompt.


  What happens next depends on whether you have an existing installation
  that you want to update with the latest and greatest or whether you
  just want to see what is there and/or run it on a new machine for
  testing.

  If you are installing Spider from CVS then change directory to
  /home/sysop

  If you are wanting to update Spider then cd to /tmp



  The next step will create a brand new 'spider' directory in your
  current directory.


  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.DXSpider.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dxspider co spider



  This command is all on one line.


  Hopefully your screen should show you downloading files.  The -z3
  simply compresses the download to improve speed.  When this has
  finished, you will have exactly the same as if you had untarred a full
  tarball PLUS some extra directories and files that CVS needs to do the
  magic that it does.


  Now if you are doing a new installation, that's it.  Carry on as if
  you have just downloaded and untarred the lastest tarball.


  If you want to upgrade your current installation then do this ...



       tar cvfz /tmp/s.tgz spider
       cd /
       tar xvfzp /tmp/s.tgz




  This is assuming you downloaded to the /tmp directory of course.


  NOTE:  the 'p' on the end of the 'xvfz' is IMPORTANT!   It keeps the
  permissions correct.  YOU WERE LOGGED IN AS THE USER SYSOP WEREN'T
  YOU?????

  Remember to recompile the C client (cd /spider/src; make)


  At this point the files have been upgraded.  You can (usually) restart
  the cluster in your own time.  However, if you attempt to use any new
  commands or features expect it to be fatal!  At least your cluster
  will have been restarted then so it will be too late to worry about
  it!


  Now the magic part!  From now on when you want to update, simply
  connect to the Internet and then, as the user _s_y_s_o_p ...



       cd /spider
       cvs -z3 update -d




  and your files will be updated.  As above, remember to recompile the
  "C" client if it has been updated (CVS will tell you) and restart if
  any of the perl scripts have been altered or added, again, CVS will
  tell you.

  You will find any changes documented in the /spider/Changes file.

  Below is a complete list of commands available from the cluster
  prompt.  Most maintenance tasks are automatic but there are some
  commands that are useful for a sysop.  These are listed below in
  alphabetical order.  The number in brackets following the command name
  is the permissions level needed to use the command.


  1133..11..  aacccceepptt//aannnnoouunnccee ((00))

  aacccceepptt//aannnnoouunnccee [[00--99]] <<ppaatttteerrnn>> Set an accept filter line for announce


  Create an 'accept this announce' line for a filter.

  An accept filter line means that if the announce matches this filter
  it is passed onto the user. See HELP FILTERS for more info. Please
  read this to understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief
  later on.

  You can use any of the following things in this line:-



         info <string>            eg: iota or qsl
         by <prefixes>            eg: G,M,2
         origin <prefixes>
         origin_dxcc <numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
         origin_itu <numbers>
         origin_zone <numbers>
         by_dxcc <numbers>
         by_itu <numbers>
         by_zone <numbers>
         channel <prefixes>
         wx 1                     filter WX announces
         dest <prefixes>          eg: 6MUK,WDX      (distros)




  some examples:-

  Create an 'accept this spot' line for a filter.


  An accept filter line means that if the spot matches this filter it is
  passed onto the user. See HELP FILTERS for more info. Please read this
  to understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief later on.

  You can use any of the following things in this line:-



         freq <range>           eg: 0/30000 or hf or hf/cw or 6m,4m,2m
         on <range>             same as 'freq'
         call <prefixes>        eg: G,PA,HB9
         info <string>          eg: iota or qsl
         by <prefixes>
         call_dxcc <numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
         call_itu <numbers>
         call_zone <numbers>
         by_dxcc <numbers>
         by_itu <numbers>
         by_zone <numbers>
         origin <prefixes>
         channel <prefixes>





  For frequencies, you can use any of the band names defined in
  SHOW/BANDS and you can use a subband name like: cw, rtty, data, ssb -
  thus: hf/ssb. You can also just have a simple range like: 0/30000 -
  this is more efficient than saying simply: freq HF (but don't get too
  hung up about that)
  some examples:-



         acc/spot 1 on hf/cw
         acc/spot 2 on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)




  You can use the tag 'all' to accept everything, eg:



         acc/spot 3 all

  When you send messages the fact that you have forwarded it to another

  partner node and you add their callsign to your /spider/msg/forward.pl
  file, all outstanding non-private messages will be forwarded to them.
  This may well be ALL the non-private messages. You can prevent this by
  using these commmands:-



         catchup GB7DJK all

  DBCREATE allows you to define a database in the system. It doesn't
  actually create anything, just defines it.

  The databases that are created are simple DB_File hash databases, they
  are therefore already 'indexed'.

  You can define a local database with the first form of the command eg:

  DBCREATE oblast

  You can also chain databases with the addition of the 'chain' keyword.
  This will search each database one after the other. A typical example
  is:

  DBCREATE sdx_qsl chain sql_ad

  No checking is done to see if the any of the chained databases exist,
  in fact it is usually better to do the above statement first then do
  each of the chained databases.
  Databases can exist offsite. To define a database that lives on
  another node do:

  DBCREATE buckmaster remote gb7dxc

  Remote databases cannot be chained; however, the last database in a a
  chain can be a remote database eg:

  DBCREATE qsl chain gb7dxc

  To see what databases have been defined do:

  DBAVAIL (or it will have been aliased to SHOW/COMMAND)

  It would be normal for you to add an entry into your local Aliases
  file to allow people to use the 'SHOW/<dbname>' style syntax. So you
  would need to add a line like:-



         's' => [
           ..
           ..
           '^sh\w*/buc', 'dbshow buckmaster', 'dbshow',
           ..
           ..
          ],




  to allow

  SH/BUCK g1tlh

  to work as they may be used to.

  See DBIMPORT for the importing of existing AK1A format data to
  databases.  See DBSHOW for generic database enquiry

  If you want to import or update data in bulk to a database you can use
  this command. It will either create or update entries into an existing
  database. For example:-

  DBIMPORT oblast /tmp/OBLAST.FUL

  will import the standard OBLAST database that comes with AK1A into the
  oblast database held locally.

  DBREMOVE will completely remove a database entry and also delete any
  data file that is associated with it.

  There is no warning, no comeback, no safety net.

  For example:

  DBREMOVE oblast

  will remove the oblast database from the system and it will also
  remove the associated datafile.

  I repeat:

  There is no warning, no comeback, no safety net.

  You have been warned.

  This is the generic user interface to the database to the database
  system.  It is expected that the sysop will add an entry to the local
  Aliases file so that users can use the more familiar AK1A style of
  enquiry such as:



         SH/BUCK G1TLH




  but if he hasn't and the database really does exist (use DBAVAIL or
  SHOW/COMMAND to find out) you can do the same thing with:

  If there is a 'p' one space after the message number then it is a
  personal message. If there is a '-' between the message number and the

  You can use shell escape characters such as '*' and '?' in the <call>
  fields.

  You can combine some of the various directory commands together eg:-



          DIR TO G1TLH 5
       or
          DIR SUBJECT IOTA 200-250




  You can abbreviate all the commands to one letter and use ak1a

  You can credit someone else by saying:-



          DX by G1TLH FR0G 144.600 he isn't on the cluster

  If the file already exists it will be renamed to <filename>.o. In fact
  up to 5 generations of the file can be kept each one with an extra 'o'
  on the suffix.

  BE WARNED: this will write to any file you have write access to. No

  Look at the APROPOS <string> command which will search the help
  database for the <string> you specify and give you a list of likely
  commands to look at with HELP.


  1133..3322..  iinniitt ((55))

  iinniitt <<nnooddee ccaallll>> Re-initialise a link to an AK1A compatible node


  This command attempts to re-initialise a link to a (usually) AK1A node
  that has got confused, usually by a protocol loop of some kind. It may
  work - but you usually will be better off simply disconnecting it (or
  better, if it is a real AK1A node, doing an RCMD <node> DISC/F <your
  node>).

  Best of luck - you will need it.

  kkiillll <<mmssggnnoo>> [[<<mmssggnnoo>> ....]] Delete a message from the local system


  Delete a message from the local system. You will only be able to
  delete messages that you have originated or been sent (unless you are
  the sysop).





  1133..3344..  kkiillll ((55))

  kkiillll <<mmssggnnoo>> [[<<mmssggnnoo>> ......]] Remove or erase a message from the system
  kkiillll ffrroomm <<ccaallll>> Remove all messages from a callsign
  kkiillll ttoo <<ccaallll>> Remove all messages to a callsign


  You can get rid of any message to or originating from your callsign
  using this command. You can remove more than one message at a time.

  As a sysop you can kill any message on the system.


  1133..3355..  kkiillll ffuullll ((55))

  Delete a message (usually a 'bulletin') from the whole cluster system.

  This uses the subject field, so any messages that have exactly the
  same subject will be deleted. Beware!


  1133..3366..  lliinnkkss ((00))

  lliinnkkss Show which nodes are physically connected


  This is a quick listing that shows which links are connected and some
  information about them. See WHO for a list of all connections.

  llooaadd//aalliiaasseess Reload the command alias table


  Reload the /spider/cmd/Aliases file after you have editted it. You
  will need to do this if you change this file whilst the cluster is
  running in order for the changes to take effect.



  1133..3388..  llooaadd//bbaaddddxx ((99))

  llooaadd//bbaaddddxx Reload the bad DX table


  Reload the /spider/data/baddx.pl file if you have changed it manually
  whilst the cluster is running. This table contains the DX Calls that,
  if spotted, will not be passed on. FR0G and TEST are classic examples.


  1133..3399..  llooaadd//bbaaddmmssgg ((99))

  llooaadd//bbaaddmmssgg Reload the bad message table


  Reload the /spider/msg/badmsg.pl file if you have changed it manually
  whilst the cluster is running. This table contains a number of perl
  regular expressions which are searched for in the fields targetted of
  each message.  If any of them match then that message is immediately
  deleted on receipt.

  1133..4400..  llooaadd//bbaaddwwoorrddss ((99))

  llooaadd//bbaaddwwoorrddss Reload the badwords file


  Reload the /spider/data/badwords file if you have changed it manually
  whilst the cluster is running. This file contains a list of words
  which, if found on certain text portions of PC protocol, will cause
  those protocol frames to be rejected. It will all put out a message if
  any of these words are used on the announce, dx and talk commands. The
  words can be one or more on a line, lines starting with '#' are
  ignored.


  1133..4411..  llooaadd//bbaannddss ((99))

  1133..4422..  llooaadd//ccmmdd__ccaacchhee ((99))

  llooaadd//ccmmdd__ccaacchhee Reload the automatic command cache


  Normally, if you change a command file in the cmd or local_cmd tree it
  will automatially be picked up by the cluster program. Sometimes it
  can get confused if you are doing a lot of moving commands about or
  delete a command in the local_cmd tree and want to use the normal one
  again. Execute this command to reset everything back to the state it
  was just after a cluster restart.


  1133..4433..  llooaadd//ffoorrwwaarrdd ((99))

  1133..4444..  llooaadd//mmeessssaaggeess ((99))

  llooaadd//mmeessssaaggeess Reload the system messages file


  If you change the /spider/perl/Messages file (usually whilst
  fiddling/writing ne commands) you can have them take effect during a
  cluster session by executing this command. You need to do this if get
  something like :-

  unknown message 'xxxx' in lang 'en'


  1133..4455..  llooaadd//pprreeffiixxeess ((99))

  llooaadd//pprreeffiixxeess Reload the prefix table


  Reload the /spider/data/prefix_data.pl file if you have changed it
  manually whilst the cluster is running.


  1133..4466..  mmeerrggee ((55))

  MERGE allows you to bring your spot and wwv database up to date. By
  default it will request the last 10 spots and 5 WWVs from the node you
  select. The node must be connected locally.

  You can request any number of spots or wwv and although they will be
  appended to your databases they will not duplicate any that have
  recently been added (the last 2 days for spots and last month for WWV
  data).


  1133..4477..  mmssgg ((99))

  mmssgg <<ccmmdd>> <<mmssggnnoo>> [[ddaattaa ......]] Alter various message parameters


  Alter message parameters like To, From, Subject, whether private or
  bulletin or return receipt (RR) is required or whether to keep this
  message from timing out.



         MSG TO <msgno> <call>     - change TO callsign to <call>
         MSG FRom <msgno> <call>   - change FROM callsign to <call>
         MSG PRrivate <msgno>      - set private flag
         MSG NOPRrivate <msgno>    - unset private flag
         MSG RR <msgno>            - set RR flag
         MSG NORR <msgno>          - unset RR flag
         MSG KEep <msgno>          - set the keep flag (message won't be deleted ever)
         MSG NOKEep <msgno>        - unset the keep flag
         MSG SUbject <msgno> <new> - change the subject to <new>
         MSG WAittime <msgno>      - remove any waitting time for this message
         MSG NOREad <msgno>        - mark message as unread
         MSG REad <msgno>          - mark message as read
         MSG QUeue                 - queue any outstanding bulletins
         MSG QUeue 1               - queue any outstanding private messages




  You can look at the status of a message by using:-

  STAT/MSG <msgno>

  This will display more information on the message than DIR does.


  1133..4488..  ppcc ((88))

  ppcc <<ccaallll>> <<tteexxtt>> Send text (eg PC Protocol) to <call>


  Send some arbitrary text to a locally connected callsign. No
  processing is done on the text. This command allows you to send PC
  Protocol to unstick things if problems arise (messages get stuck etc).
  eg:-

  pc gb7djk PC33^GB7TLH^GB7DJK^400^

  You can also use in the same way as a talk command to a connected user
  but without any processing, added of "from <blah> to <blah>" or
  whatever.
  pc G1TLH Try doing that properly!!!


  1133..4499..  ppiinngg ((11))

  ppiinngg <<nnooddee>> Check the link quality between nodes


  his command allows you to send a frame to another cluster node on the
  network and get a return frame.  The time it takes to do this is a
  good indication of the quality of the link.  The actual time it takes
  is output to the console in seconds.  Any visible cluster node can be
  PINGed.



  1133..5500..  rrccmmdd ((11))

  rrccmmdd <<nnooddee ccaallll>> <<ccmmdd>> Send a command to another DX cluster


  This command allows you to send nearly any command to another DX
  Cluster node that is connected to the system.

  Whether you get any output is dependant on a) whether the other system
  knows that the node callsign of this cluster is in fact a node b)
  whether the other system is allowing RCMDs from this node and c)
  whether you have permission to send this command at all.


  1133..5511..  rreeaadd ((00))

  rreeaadd Read the next unread personal message addressed to you
  rreeaadd <<mmssggnnoo>> Read the specified message


  You can read any messages that are sent as 'non-personal' and also any
  message either sent by or sent to your callsign.



  1133..5522..  rreeaadd ((eexxtteennddeedd ffoorr ssyyssooppss)) ((55))

  rreeaadd <<mmssggnnoo>> Read a message on the system


  As a sysop you may read any message on the system


  1133..5533..  rreejjeecctt//aannnnoouunnccee

  Create an 'reject this announce' line for a filter.

  An reject filter line means that if the announce matches this filter
  it is passed onto the user. See HELP FILTERS for more info. Please
  read this to understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief
  later on.

  You can use any of the following things in this line:-




    info <string>            eg: iota or qsl
    by <prefixes>            eg: G,M,2
    origin <prefixes>
    origin_dxcc <numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
    origin_itu <numbers>
    origin_zone <numbers>

    dest <prefixes>          eg: 6MUK,WDX      (distros)




  some examples:-



         rej/ann by_zone 14,15,16 and not by G,M,2




  You can use the tag 'all' to reject everything eg:



         rej/ann all




  but this probably for advanced users...

  This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as
  the default for nodes and users eg:-

  Create a 'reject this spot' line for a filter.

  A reject filter line means that if the spot matches this filter it is
  dumped (not passed on). See HELP FILTERS for more info. Please read
  this to understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief
  later on.

  You can use any of the following things in this line:-



         freq <range>           eg: 0/30000 or hf or hf/cw or 6m,4m,2m
         on <range>             same as 'freq'
         call <prefixes>        eg: G,PA,HB9
         info <string>          eg: iota or qsl
         by <prefixes>
         call_dxcc <numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
         call_itu <numbers>
         call_zone <numbers>
         by_dxcc <numbers>
         by_itu <numbers>
         by_zone <numbers>
         origin <prefixes>
         channel <prefixes>




  For frequencies, you can use any of the band names defined in
  SHOW/BANDS and you can use a subband name like: cw, rtty, data, ssb -
  thus: hf/ssb. You can also just have a simple range like: 0/30000 -
  this is more efficient than saying simply: on HF (but don't get too
  hung up about that)

  some examples:-



         rej/spot 1 on hf
         rej/spot 2 on vhf and not (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)




  You can use the tag 'all' to reject everything eg:



         rej/spot 3 all

  It is unlikely that you will want to do this, but if you do then you
  can filter on the following fields:-



         by <prefixes>            eg: G,M,2
         origin <prefixes>

  node that that callsign is connected to.

  You can have more than one callsign in all of the SEND commands.

  You can have multiple qualifiers so that you can have for example:-



         SEND RR COPY 123 PRIVATE G1TLH G0RDI




  which should send a copy of message 123 to G1TLH and G0RDI and you
  will receive a read receipt when they have read the message.

  SB is an alias for SEND NOPRIVATE (or send a bulletin in BBS speak) SP

  counter


  From version 1.35 onwards neighbouring nodes are pinged at regular
  intervals (see SET/PINGINTERVAL), usually 300 seconds or 5 minutes.
  There is a 'pump-up' counter which is decremented on every outgoing
  ping and then reset to the 'obscount' value on every incoming ping.
  The default value of this parameter is 2.

  What this means is that a neighbouring node will be pinged twice at
  (default) 300 second intervals and if no reply has been heard just
  before what would be the third attempt, that node is disconnected.

  If a ping is heard then the obscount is reset to the full value. Using
  default values, if a node has not responded to a ping within 15
  minutes, it is disconnected.

  As from version 1.35 all neighbouring nodes are pinged at regular
  intervals in order to determine the rolling quality of the link and,
  in future, to affect routing decisions. The default interval is 300
  secs or 5 minutes.

  You can use this command to set a different interval. Please don't.

  But if you do the value you enter is treated as minutes up 60 and
  seconds for numbers greater than that.

  This is used also to help determine when a link is down at the far end
  (as certain cluster software doesn't always notice), see SET/OBSCOUNT
  for more information.

  by <call>       - any spots spotted by <call> (spotter <call>
                          is the same).

  qsl             - this automatically looks for any qsl info on the call
                    held in the spot database.

  iota [<iota>]   - If the iota island number is missing it will
                    look for the string iota and anything which looks like
                    an iota island number. If you specify then it will look
                    for that island.

  qra [<locator>] - this will look for the specific locator if
                    you specify one or else anything that looks like a locator.




  e.g.

  currently at those locations.

  If you don't specify any prefixes or callsigns, it will show the times
  for your QTH (assuming you have set it with either SET/LOCATION or
  SET/QRA), together with the current azimuth and elevation.

  In addition, it will show the gain or loss dB relative to the nominal
  distance of 385,000Km due to the ellipsoidal nature of the orbit.

  If all else fails it will show the Moonrise and set times for the node
  that you are connected to.

  1133..111155..  sshhooww//mmuuff ((00))

  <prefix>


  This command allow you to estimate the likelihood of you contacting a
  station with the prefix you have specified. The output assumes a
  modest power of 20dBW and receiver sensitivity of -123dBm (about
  0.15muV/10dB SINAD)

  The result predicts the most likely operating frequencies and signal
  levels for high frequency (shortwave) radio propagation paths on
  specified days of the year and hours of the day. It is most useful for
  paths between 250 km and 6000 km, but can be used with reduced
  accuracy for paths shorter or longer than this.

  The command uses a routine MINIMUF 3.5 developed by the U.S. Navy and
  used to predict the MUF given the predicted flux, day of the year,
  hour of the day and geographic coordinates of the transmitter and
  receiver. This routine is reasonably accurate for the purposes here,
  with a claimed RMS error of 3.8 MHz, but much smaller and less complex
  than the programs used by major shortwave broadcasting organizations,
  such as the Voice of America.

  The command will display some header information detailing its
  assumptions, together with the locations, latitude and longitudes and
  bearings. It will then show UTC (UT), local time at the other end
  (LT), calculate the MUFs, Sun zenith angle at the midpoint of the path
  (Zen) and the likely signal strengths. Then for each frequency for
  which the system thinks there is a likelihood of a circuit it prints a
  value.

  The value is currently a likely S meter reading based on the
  conventional 6dB / S point scale. If the value has a '+' appended it
  means that it is 1/2 an S point stronger. If the value is preceeded by
  an 'm' it means that there is likely to be much fading and by an 's'
  that the signal is likely to be noisy.

  By default SHOW/MUF will show the next two hours worth of data. You
  can specify anything up to 24 hours worth of data by appending the no
  of hours required after the prefix. For example:-



         SH/MUF W




  produces:



         RxSens: -123 dBM SFI: 159   R: 193   Month: 10   Day: 21
         Power :   20 dBW    Distance:  6283 km    Delay: 22.4 ms
         Location                       Lat / Long           Azim
         East Dereham, Norfolk          52 41 N 0 57 E         47
         United-States-W                43 0 N 87 54 W        299
         UT LT  MUF Zen  1.8  3.5  7.0 10.1 14.0 18.1 21.0 24.9 28.0 50.0
         18 23 11.5 -35  mS0+ mS2   S3
         19  0 11.2 -41  mS0+ mS2   S3




  indicating that you will have weak, fading circuits on top band and
  80m but usable signals on 40m (about S3).

  inputing:-



         SH/MUF W 24

  will get you the above display, but with the next 24 hours worth of
  propagation data.



         SH/MUF W L 24
         SH/MUF W 24 Long




  Gives you an estimate of the long path propagation characterics. It
  should be noted that the figures will probably not be very useful, nor
  terrible accurate, but it is included for completeness.

  sshhooww//qqrraa <<llaatt>> <<lloonngg>> Convert latitude and longitude to a locator


  This is a multipurpose command that allows you either to calculate the
  distance and bearing between two locators or (if only one locator is
  given on the command line) the distance and beraing from your station
  to the locator. For example:-



       SH/QRA IO92QL
       SH/QRA JN06 IN73

  The first example will show the distance and bearing to the locator
  from yourself, the second example will calculate the distance and
  bearing from the first locator to the second. You can use 4 or 6
  character locators.

  It is also possible to convert a latitude and longitude to a locator
  by using this command with a latitude and longitude as an argument,
  for example:-



       SH/QRA 52 41 N 0 58 E

  data


  Show the tracking data from your location to the satellite of your
  choice from now on for the next few hours.

  If you use this command without a satellite name it will display a
  list of all the satellites known currently to the system.

  If you give a name then you can obtain tracking data of all the passes
  that start and finish 5 degrees below the horizon. As default it will
  give information for the next three hours for every five minute
  period.

  You can alter the number of hours and the step size, within certain
  limits.

  ssyyssoopp Regain your privileges if you login remotely


  The system automatically reduces your privilege level to that of a
  normal user if you login in remotely. This command allows you to
  regain your normal privilege level. It uses the normal system: five
  numbers are returned that are indexes into the character array that is
  your assigned password (see SET/PASSWORD). The indexes start from
  zero.

  You are expected to return a string which contains the characters
  required in the correct order. You may intersperse those characters
  with others to obscure your reply for any watchers. For example (and
  these values are for explanation :-):



         password = 012345678901234567890123456789
         > sysop
         22 10 15 17 3




  you type:-



        aa2bbbb0ccc5ddd7xxx3n
        or 2 0 5 7 3
        or 20573




  They will all match. If there is no password you will still be offered
  numbers but nothing will happen when you input a string. Any match is
  case sensitive.

  <callsign> via <node_call>


  Send a short message to any other station that is visible on the
  cluster system. You can send it to anyone you can see with a
  SHOW/CONFIGURATION command, they don't have to be connected locally.

  The second form of TALK is used when other cluster nodes are connected
  with restricted information. This usually means that they don't send
  the user information usually associated with logging on and off the
  cluster.

  If you know that G3JNB is likely to be present on GB7TLH, but you can
  only see GB7TLH in the SH/C list but with no users, then you would use
  the second form of the talk message.

  If you want to have a ragchew with someone you can leave the text
  message out and the system will go into 'Talk' mode. What this means
  is that a short message is sent to the recipient telling them that you
  are in a 'Talking' frame of mind and then you just type - everything
  you send will go to the station that you asked for.

  All the usual announcements, spots and so on will still come out on
  your terminal.

  If you want to do something (such as send a spot) you precede the
  normal command with a '/' character, eg:-



          /DX 14001 G1TLH What's a B class licensee doing on 20m CW?
          /HELP talk




  To leave talk mode type:
