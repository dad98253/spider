  1.  Hop control

  Starting with version 1.13 there is simple hop control available on a
  per node basis. Also it is possible to isolate a network completely so
  that you get all the benefits of being on that network, but can't pass
  on information from it to any other networks you may be connected to
  (or vice versa).


  1.1.  Basic hop control

  In /spider/data you will find a file called hop_table.pl.  This is the
  file that controls your hop count settings.  It has a set of default
  hops on the various PC frames and also a set for each node you want to
  alter the hops for.  You may be happy with the default settings of
  course, but this powerful tool can help to protect and improve the
  network.  The file will look something like this ...












































  #
  # hop table construction
  #

  package DXProt;

  # default hopcount to use
  $def_hopcount = 5;

  # some variable hop counts based on message type
  %hopcount =
  (
   11 => 10,
   16 => 10,
   17 => 10,
   19 => 10,
   21 => 10,
  );


  # the per node hop control thingy


  %nodehops =

   GB7ADX => {            11 => 8,
                          12 => 8,
                          16 => 8,
                          17 => 8,
                          19 => 8,
                          21 => 8,
                     },

   GB7UDX => {            11 => 8,
                          12 => 8,
                          16 => 8,
                          17 => 8,
                          19 => 8,
                          21 => 8,
                     },
   GB7BAA => {
                          11 => 5,
                          12 => 8,
                          16 => 8,
                          17 => 8,
                          19 => 8,
                          21 => 8,
                     },
  };





  Each set of hops is contained within a pair of curly braces and
  contains a series of PC frame types.  PC11 for example is a DX spot.
  The figures here are not exhaustive but should give you a good idea of
  how the file works.


  You can alter this file at any time, including whilst the cluster is
  running.  If you alter the file during runtime, the command load/hops
  will bring your changes into effect.



  1.2.  Isolating networks

  It is possible to isolate networks from each other on a "gateway" node
  using the set/isolate <node_call> command.


  The effect of this is to partition an isolated network completely from
  another nodes connected to your node. Your node will appear on and
  otherwise behave normally on every network to which you are connected,
  but data from an isolated network will not cross onto any other
  network or vice versa. However all the spot, announce and WWV traffic
  and personal messages will still be handled locally (because you are a
  real node on all connected networks), that is locally connected users
  will appear on all networks and will be able to access and receive
  information from all networks transparently.  All routed messages will
  be sent as normal, so if a user on one network knows that you are a
  gateway for another network, he can still still send a talk/announce
  etc message via your node and it will be routed across.


  The only limitation currently is that non-private messages cannot be
  passed down isolated links regardless of whether they are generated
  locally. This will change when the bulletin routing facility is added.


  If you use isolate on a node connection you will continue to receive
  all information from the isolated partner, however you will not pass
  any information back to the isolated node.  There are times when you
  would like to forward only spots across a link (maybe during a contest
  for example).  To do this, isolate the node in the normal way and put
  in a filter in the /spider/filter/spots directory to override the
  isolate.  This filter can be very simple and consists of just one line
  ....



       $in = [
               [ 1, 0, 'd', 0, 3]      # The last figure (3) is the hop count
       ];





  There is a lot more on filtering in the next section.


  2.  Filtering (Old Style upto v1.44)

  Filters can be set for spots, announcements and WWV.  You will find
  the directories for these under /spider/filter.  You will find some
  examples in the directories with the suffix .issue.  There are two
  types of filter, one for incoming information and one for outgoing
  information.  Outgoing filters are in the form CALLSIGN.pl and
  incoming filters are in the form in_CALLSIGN.pl.  Filters can be set
  for both nodes and users.


  All filters work in basically the same way.  There are several
  elements delimited by commas.  There can be many lines in the filter
  and they are read from the top by the program.  When writing a filter
  you need to think carefully about just what you want to achieve.  You
  are either going to write a filter to accept or to reject.  Think of a
  filter as having 2 main elements.  For a reject filter, you would have
  a line or multiple lines rejecting the things you do not wish to
  receive and then a default line accepting everything else that is not
  included in the filter.  Likewise, for an accept filter, you would
  have a line or multiple lines accepting the things you wish to receive
  and a default line rejecting everthing else.


  In the example below, a user requires a filter that would only return
  SSB spots posted in Europe on the HF bands.  This is achieved by first
  rejecting the CW section of each HF band and rejecting all of VHF, UHF
  etc based on frequency.  Secondly, a filter rule is set based on CQ
  zones to only accept spots posted in Europe.  Lastly, a default filter
  rule is set to reject anything outside the filter.



       $in = [
               [ 0, 0, 'r', # reject all CW spots
                       [
                       1800.0, 1850.0,
                       3500.0, 3600.0,
                       7000.0, 7040.0,
                       14000.0, 14100.0,
                       18068.0, 18110.0,
                       21000.0, 21150.0,
                       24890.0, 24930.0,
                       28000.0, 28180.0,
                       30000.0, 49000000000.0,
                       ] ,1 ],
               [ 1, 11, 'n', [ 14, 15, 16, 20, 33, ], 15 ], #accept EU
               [ 0, 0, 'd', 0, 1 ], # 1 = want, 'd' = everything else
       ];





  The actual elements of each filter are described more fully in the
  following sections.


  2.1.  Spots

  The elements of the Spot filter are ....



       [action, field_no, sort, possible_values, hops]





  There are 3 elements here to look at.  Firstly, the action element.
  This is very simple and only 2 possible states exist, accept (1) or
  drop (0).


  The second element is the field_no.  There are 13 possiblities to
  choose from here ....








        0 = frequency
        1 = call
        2 = date in unix format
        3 = comment
        4 = spotter
        5 = spotted dxcc country
        6 = spotter's dxcc country
        7 = origin
        8 = spotted itu
        9 = spotted cq
        10 = spotter's itu
        11 = spotter's cq
        12 = callsign of the channel on which the spot has appeared





  The third element tells us what to expect in the fourth element.
  There are 4 possibilities ....



            n - numeric list of numbers e.g. [ 1,2,3 ]
            r - ranges of pairs of numbers e.g. between 2 and 4 or 10 to 17 - [ 2,4, 10,17 ]
            a - an alphanumeric regex
            d - the default rule





  The fifth element is simply the hops to set in this filter.  This
  would only be used if the filter was for a node of course and
  overrides the hop count in hop_table.pl.


  So, let's look at an example spot filter.  It does not matter in the
  example who the filter is to be used for.  So, what do we need in the
  filter?  We need to filter the spots the user/node requires and also
  set a default rule for anything else outside the filter.  Below is a
  simple filter that stops spots arriving from outside Europe.



       $in = [
         [ 0, 4, 'a', '^(K|N|A|W|VE|VA|J)'],  # 0 = drop, 'a' = alphanumeric
         [ 1, 0, 'd', 0, 1 ],                 # 1 = want, 'd' = everything else
                            ];





  So the filter is wrapped in between a pair of square brackets.  This
  tells Spider to look in between these limits.  Then each line is
  contained within its own square brackets and ends with a comma. Lets
  look carefully at the first line.  The first element is 0 (drop).
  Therefore anything we put on this line will not be accepted.  The next
  element is 4.  This means we are filtering by the spotter.  The third
  element is the letter "a" which tells the program to expect an
  alphanumeric expression in the fourth element.  The fourth element is
  a list of letters separated by the pipe symbol.



  What this line does is tell the program to drop any spots posted by
  anyone in the USA, Canada or Japan.


  The second line is the default rule for anything else.  The "d" tells
  us this and the line simply reads... accept anything else.


  You can add as many lines as you need to complete the filter but if
  there are several lines of the same type it is neater to enclose them
  all as one line.  An example of this is where specific bands are set.
  We could write this like this ....



       [ 0,0,'r',[1800.0, 2000.0], 1],
       [ 0,0,'r',[10100.0, 10150.0], 1],
       [ 0,0,'r',[14000.0, 14350.0], 1],
       [ 0,0,'r',[18000.0, 18200.0], 1],





  But the line below achieves the same thing and is more efficient ....



         [ 0, 0, 'r',
           [
             1800.0, 2000.0,         # top band
             10100.0, 10150.0,       # WARC
             14000.0, 14350.0,       # 20m
             18000.0, 18200.0,       # WARC
           [ ,1 ],






  2.2.  Announcements




       # This is an example announce or filter allowing only West EU announces
       #
       # The element list is:-
       # 0 - callsign of announcer
       # 1 - destination * = all, <callsign> = routed to the node
       # 2 - text
       # 3 - * - sysop, <some text> - special list eg 6MUK, ' ', normal announce
       # 4 - origin
       # 5 - 0 - announce, 1 - wx
       # 6 - channel callsign (the interface from which this spot came)

       $in = [
               [ 1, 0, 'a', '^(P[ABCDE]|DK0WCY|G|M|2|EI|F|ON)' ],
               [ 0, 0, 'd', 0 ]
       ];





  In this example, only the prefixes listed will be allowed.  It is
  possible to be quite specific.  The Dutch prefix "P" is followed by
  several secondary identifiers which are allowed.  So, in the example,
  "PA" or "PE" would be ok but not "PG".  It is even possible to allow
  information from a single callsign.  In the example this is DK0WCY, to
  allow the posting of his Aurora Beacon.


  2.3.  WWV




       # This is an example WWV filter
       #
       # The element list is:-
       # 0 - nominal unix date of spot (ie the day + hour:13)
       # 1 - the hour
       # 2 - SFI
       # 3 - K
       # 4 - I
       # 5 - text
       # 6 - spotter
       # 7 - origin
       # 8 - incoming interface callsign

       # this one doesn't filter, it just sets the hop count to 6 and is
       # used mainly just to override any isolation from WWV coming from
       # the internet.

       $in = [
               [ 1, 0, 'd', 0, 6 ]
       ];





  It should be noted that the filter will start to be used only once a
  user/node has logged out and back in again.

  I am not going to spend any more time on these filters now as they
  will become more "comprehensive" in the near future.


  3.  Filtering (New Style v1.45 and later)

  3.1.  General filter rules

  Upto v1.44 it was not possible for the user to set their own filters.
  From v1.45 though that has all changed.  It is now possible to set
  filters for just about anything you wish.  If you have just updated
  from an older version of DXSpider you will need to update your new
  filters.  You do not need to do anything with your old filters, they
  will be renamed as you update.


  There are 3 basic commands involved in setting and manipulating
  filters.  These are accept, reject and clear.  First we will look
  generally at filtering. There are a number of things you can filter in
  the DXSpider system. They all use the same general mechanism.


  In general terms you can create a 'reject' or an 'accept' filter which
  can have up to 10 lines in it. You do this using, for example ...

       accept/spots .....
       reject/spots .....




  where ..... are the specific commands for that type of filter. There
  are filters for spots, wwv, announce, wcy and (for sysops) connects.
  See each different accept or reject command reference for more
  details.

  There is also a command to clear out one or more lines in a filter.
  They are ...



       clear/spots 1
       clear/spots all




  There is clear/xxxx command for each type of filter.


  and you can check that your filters have worked by the command ...




       show/filter





  For now we are going to use spots for the examples, but you can apply
  the same principles to all types of filter.


  3.2.  Types of filter

  There are two main types of filter, accept or reject.  You can use
  either to achieve the result you want dependent on your own preference
  and which is more simple to do.  It is pointless writing 8 lines of
  reject filters when 1 accept filter would do the same thing!  Each
  filter has 10 lines (of any length) which are tried in order.  If a
  line matches then the action you have specified is taken (ie reject
  means ignore it and accept means take it)


  If you specify reject filters, then any lines that arrive that match
  the filter will be dumped but all else will be accepted.  If you use
  an accept filter, then ONLY the lines in the filter will be accepted
  and all else will be dumped.  For example if you have a single line
  accept filter ...



       accept/spots on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)




  then you will ONLY get VHF spots from or to CQ zones 14, 15 and 16.

  If you set a reject filter like this ...



       reject/spots on hf/cw




  Then you will get everything EXCEPT HF CW spots.  You could make this
  single filter even more flexible.  For example, if you are interested
  in IOTA and will work it even on CW even though normally you are not
  interested in CW, then you could say ...



       reject/spots on hf/cw and not info iota




  But in that case you might only be interested in iota and say:-



       accept/spots not on hf/cw or info iota




  which achieves exactly the same thing. You should choose one or the
  other until you are comfortable with the way it works. You can mix
  them if you wish (actually you can have an accept AND a reject on the
  same line) but don't attempt this until you are sure you know what you
  are doing!


  You can arrange your filter lines into logical units, either for your
  own understanding or simply convenience. Here is an example ...



       reject/spots 1 on hf/cw
       reject/spots 2 on 50000/1400000 not (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)




  What this does is to ignore all HF CW spots and also rejects any spots
  on VHF which don't either originate or spot someone in Europe.


  This is an example where you would use a line number (1 and 2 in this
  case), if you leave the digit out, the system assumes '1'. Digits
  '0'-'9' are available.  This make it easier to see just what filters
  you have set.  It also makes it more simple to remove individual
  filters, during a contest for example.


  You will notice in the above example that the second line has
  brackets.  Look at the line logically.  You can see there are 2
  separate sections to it.  We are saying reject spots that are VHF or
  above APART from those in zones 14, 15 and 16 (either spotted there or
  originated there).  If you did not have the brackets to separate the 2
  sections, then Spider would read it logically from the front and see a
  different expression entirely ...
       (on 50000/1400000 and by_zone 14,15,16) or call_zone 14,15,16




  The simple way to remember this is, if you use OR - use brackets.
  Whilst we are here CASE is not important. 'And BY_Zone' is just the
  same as 'and by_zone'.

  As mentioned earlier, setting several filters can be more flexible
  than simply setting one complex one.  Doing it in this way means that
  if you want to alter your filter you can just redefine or remove one
  or more lines of it or one line. For example ...



       reject/spots 1 on hf/ssb




  would redefine our earlier example, or



       clear/spots 1




  To remove all the filter lines in the spot filter ...



       clear/spots all





  3.3.  Filter options

  You can filter in several different ways.  The options are listed in
  the various helpfiles for accept, reject and filter.


  3.4.  Default filters

  Sometimes all that is needed is a general rule for node connects.
  This can be done with a node_default filter.  This rule will always be
  followed, even if the link is isolated, unless another filter is set
  specifically.  Default rules can be set for nodes and users.  They can
  be set for spots, announces, WWV and WCY.  They can also be used for
  hops.  An example might look like this ...



       accept/spot node_default by_zone 14,15,16,20,33
       set/hops node_default spot 50




  This filter is for spots only, you could set others for announce, WWV
  and WCY.  This filter would work for ALL nodes unless a specific
  filter is written to override it for a particular node.  You can also
  set a user_default should you require.  It is important to note that
  default filters should be considered to be "connected".  By this I
  mean that should you override the default filter for spots, you need
  to add a rule for the hops for spots also.


  3.5.  Advanced filtering

  Once you are happy with the results you get, you may like to
  experiment.


  The previous example that filters hf/cw spots and accepts vhf/uhf
  spots from EU can be written with a mixed filter, for example ...



       rej/spot on hf/cw
       acc/spot on 0/30000
       acc/spot 2 on 50000/1400000 and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)




  Note that the first filter has not been specified with a number.  This
  will automatically be assumed to be number 1.  In this case, we have
  said reject all HF spots in the CW section of the bands but accept all
  others at HF.  Also accept anything in VHF and above spotted in or by
  operators in the zones 14, 15 and 16.  Each filter slot actually has a
  'reject' slot and an 'accept' slot. The reject slot is executed BEFORE
  the accept slot.


  It was mentioned earlier that after a reject test that doesn't match,
  the default for following tests is 'accept', the reverse is true for
  'accept'. In the example what happens is that the reject is executed
  first, any non hf/cw spot is passed to the accept line, which lets
  through everything else on HF.  The next filter line lets through just
  VHF/UHF spots from EU.



  4.  Other filters

  4.1.  Filtering Mail

  In the /spider/msg directory you will find a file called
  badmsg.pl.issue.  Rename this to badmsg.pl and edit the file.  The
  original looks something like this ....

















  # the list of regexes for messages that we won't store having
  # received them (bear in mind that we must receive them fully before
  # we can bin them)


  # The format of each line is as follows

  #     type      source             pattern
  #     P/B/F     T/F/O/S            regex

  # type: P - private, B - bulletin (msg), F - file (ak1a bull)
  # source: T - to field, F - from field,  O - origin, S - subject
  # pattern: a perl regex on the field requested

  # Currently only type B and P msgs are affected by this code.
  #
  # The list is read from the top down, the first pattern that matches
  # causes the action to be taken.

  # The pattern can be undef or 0 in which case it will always be selected
  # for the action specified



  package DXMsg;

  @badmsg = (
  );





  I think this is fairly self explanatory.  It is simply a list of
  subject headers that we do not want to pass on to either the users of
  the cluster or the other cluster nodes that we are linked to.  This is
  usually because of rules and regulations pertaining to items for sale
  etc in a particular country.


  4.2.  Filtering DX callouts (Depricated)

  From version 1.47, this method is replaced by the command set/baddx


  In the same way as mail, there are some types of spot we do not wish
  to pass on to users or linked cluster nodes.  In the /spider/data
  directory you will find a file called baddx.pl.issue.  Rename this to
  baddx.pl and edit the file.  The original looks like this ....

















  # the list of dx spot addresses that we don't store and don't pass on


  package DXProt;

  @baddx = qw

   FROG
   SALE
   FORSALE
   WANTED
   P1RATE
   PIRATE
   TEST
   DXTEST
   NIL
   NOCALL
  );





  Again, this is simply a list of names we do not want to see in the
  spotted field of a DX callout.



  4.3.  Filtering words from text fields in Announce, Talk and DX spots

  Create a file in /spider/data called badwords.  The format is quite
  simple.  Lines beginning with # are ignored so comments can be added.
  An example file is below ...



       # Below is a list of words we do not wish to see on the cluster
       grunge grunged grunging
       splodge splodger splodging
       grince
       fluffle




  Multiple words can be used on the same line as shown.  Obviously these
  are just examples :-)


  You can reload the file from the cluster prompt as sysop with
  load/badwords.


  5.  Mail

  DXSpider deals seamlessly with standard AK1A type mail.  It supports
  both personal and bulletin mail and the sysop has additional commands
  to ensure that mail gets to where it is meant.  DXSpider will send
  mail almost immediately, assuming that the target is on line.
  However, only one mail message is dealt with at any one time.  If a
  mail message is already being sent or recieved, then the new message
  will be queued until it has finished.

  The cluster mail is automatically deleted after 30 days unless the
  sysop sets the "keep" flag using the msg command.

  5.1.  Personal mail

  Personal mail is sent using the sp command.  This is actually the
  default method of sending mail and so a simple s for send will do.  A
  full list of the send commands and options is in the command set
  section, so I will not duplicate them here.


  5.2.  Bulletin mail

  Bulletin mail is sent by using the sb command.  This is one of the
  most common mistakes users make when sending mail.  They send a
  bulletin mail with s or sp instead of sb and of course the message
  never leaves the cluster.  This can be rectified by the sysop by using
  the msg command.


  Bulletin addresses can be set using the Forward.pl file.


  5.3.  Forward.pl

  DXSpider receives all and any mail sent to it without any alterations
  needed in files.  Because personal and bulletin mail are treated
  differently, there is no need for a list of accepted bulletin
  addresses.  It is necessary, however, to tell the program which links
  accept which bulletins.  For example, it is pointless sending
  bulletins addresses to "UK" to any links other than UK ones.  The file
  that does this is called forward.pl and lives in /spider/msg.  At
  default, like other spider files it is named forward.pl.issue.  Rename
  it to forward.pl and edit the file to match your requirements.  The
  format is below ...


































  #
  # this is an example message forwarding file for the system
  #
  # The format of each line is as follows
  #
  #     type    to/from/at pattern action  destinations
  #     P/B/F     T/F/A     regex   I/F    [ call [, call ...] ]
  #
  # type: P - private, B - bulletin (msg), F - file (ak1a bull)
  # to/from/at: T - to field, F - from field, A - home bbs, O - origin
  # pattern: a perl regex on the field requested
  # action: I - ignore, F - forward
  # destinations: a reference to an array containing node callsigns
  #
  # if it is non-private and isn't in here then it won't get forwarded
  #
  # Currently only type B msgs are affected by this code.
  #
  # The list is read from the top down, the first pattern that matches
  # causes the action to be taken.
  #
  # The pattern can be undef or 0 in which case it will always be selected
  # for the action specified
  #
  # If the BBS list is undef or 0 and the action is 'F' (and it matches the
  # pattern) then it will always be forwarded to every node that doesn't have
  # it (I strongly recommend you don't use this unless you REALLY mean it, if
  # you allow a new link with this on EVERY bull will be forwarded immediately
  # on first connection)
  #

  package DXMsg;

  @forward = (
  );




  Simply insert a bulletin address and state in the brackets where you
  wish that mail to go.  For example, you can see here that mail sent to
  "UK" will only be sent to the UK links and not to PA4AB-14.


  To force the cluster to reread the file use load/forward



  5.4.  The msg command

  The msg command is a very powerful and flexible tool for the sysop.
  It allows the sysop to alter to and from fields and make other changes
  to manage the cluster mail.

  Here is a full list of the various options ...











    MSG TO <msgno> <call>     - change TO callsign to <call>
    MSG FRom <msgno> <call>   - change FROM callsign to <call>
    MSG PRrivate <msgno>      - set private flag
    MSG NOPRrivate <msgno>    - unset private flag
    MSG RR <msgno>            - set RR flag
    MSG NORR <msgno>          - unset RR flag
    MSG KEep <msgno>          - set the keep flag (message won't be deleted ever)
    MSG NOKEep <msgno>        - unset the keep flag
    MSG SUbject <msgno> <new> - change the subject to <new>
    MSG WAittime <msgno>      - remove any waiting time for this message
    MSG NOREad <msgno>        - mark message as unread
    MSG REad <msgno>          - mark message as read
    MSG QUeue                 - queue any outstanding bulletins
    MSG QUeue 1               - queue any outstanding private messages




  These commands are simply typed from within the cluster as the sysop
  user.


  5.5.  Message status

  You can check on a message from within the cluster by using the
  command stat/msg.  This will give you additional information on the
  message number including which nodes have received it, which node it
  was received from and when etc.  Here is an example of the output of
  the command ...



       G0VGS de GB7MBC 28-Jan-2001 1308Z >
       stat/msg 6869
               From: GB7DJK
           Msg Time: 26-Jan-2001 1302Z
              Msgno: 6869
             Origin: GB7DJK
               Size: 8012
            Subject: AMSAT 2line KEPS 01025.AMSAT
                 To: UK
       Got it Nodes: GB7BAA, GB7ADX
            Private: 0
       Read Confirm: 0
         Times read: 0
       G0VGS de GB7MBC 28-Jan-2001 1308Z >





  5.6.  Filtering mail

  This is described in the section on Other filters so I will not
  duplicate it here.


  5.7.  Distribution lists

  Distribution lists are simply a list of users to send certain types of
  mail to.  An example of this is mail you only wish to send to other
  sysops.  In /spider/msg there is a directory called distro.  You put
  any distibution lists in here.  For example, here is a file called
  SYSOP.pl that caters for the UK sysops.


       qw(GB7TLH GB7DJK GB7DXM GB7CDX GB7BPQ GB7DXN GB7MBC GB7MBC-6 GB7MDX
          GB7NDX GB7SDX GB7TDX GB7UDX GB7YDX GB7ADX GB7BAA GB7DXA GB7DXH
          GB7DXK GB7DXI GB7DXS)




  Any mail sent to "sysop" would only be sent to the callsigns in this
  list.


  5.8.  BBS interface

  Spider provides a simple BBS interface.  No input is required from the
  sysop of the cluster at all.  The BBS simply sets the cluster as a BBS
  and pushes any required mail to the cluster.  No mail can flow from
  Spider to the BBS, the interface is one-way.


  Please be careful not to flood the cluster network with unnecessary
  mail.  Make sure you only send mail to the clusters that want it by
  using the Forward.pl file very carefully.


  6.  Databases

  Spider allows the creation of local or remote databases.  It supports
  chained databases, allowing several different databases to be scanned
  with one simple command.  Importing of databases is limited at present
  to the standard AK1A databases such as OBLAST and the DB0SDX QSL
  database but will expand with time.


  6.1.  Creating databases

  Creating a database could not be more simple.  All the commands are
  sent from the cluster prompt as the sysop user.

  To create a database you use the command dbcreate.  It can be used in
  3 different ways like so ..



       dbcreate <name>




  To simply create a database locally, you just tell the command the
  name of the database.  This does not create the actual database, it
  simply defines it to say that it exists.



       dbcreate <name> chain <name> [<name>...]




  This creates a chained database entry.  The first database will be
  scanned, then the second, the third etc...



       dbcreate <name> remote <name>

  This creates a remote entry.  the first name field is the database
  name at the remote node, then the remote switch, then the actual
  node_call of the remote node, for example...



       dbcreate buckmaster remote gb7dxc




  Remote databases cannot be chained, however, the last database in a
  chain can be a remote database.


  6.2.  Importing databases

  The only databases that Spider can currently import are the standard
  AK1A databases such as OBLAST or the DB0SDX qsl and address database.
  This will be added to with time.

  To import such a database, first put the file somewhere useful like
  /tmp and then issue the following command ...



       dbimport oblast /tmp/OBLAST.FUL




  This will update the existing local oblast database or create it if it
  does not exist.


  6.3.  Checking available databases

  Once a database is created, you will want to check that it has been
  added.  To do this use the dbavail command.  This will output the
  available databases.  For example ...



       dbavail
       DB Name          Location   Chain
       qsl              Local
       buck             GB7ADX
       hftest           GB7DXM
       G0VGS de GB7MBC  3-Feb-2001 1925Z >





  6.4.  Looking up databases

  To look for information in a defined database, simply use the dbshow
  command, for example ...



       dbshow buckmaster G0YLM




  will show the information for the callsign G0YLM from the buckmaster
  database if it exists.  To make things more standard for the users you
  can add an entry in the Aliases file so that it looks like a standard
  show command like this ...







  Now you can simply use show/buckmaster or an abreviation.


  6.5.  Removing databases

  To delete an existing database you use the dbremove command.  For
  example ...



       dbremove oblast




  would remove the oblast database and its associated datafile from the
  system.  There are no warnings or recovery possible from this command.
  If you remove a database it ceases to exist and would have to be
  created from scratch if you still required it.


  7.  Information, files and useful programs

  7.1.  MOTD

  One of the more important things a cluster sysop needs to do is to get
  information to his users.  The simplest way to do this is to have a
  banner that is sent to the user on login.  This is know as a "message
  of the day" or "motd".  To set this up, simply create a file in
  /spider/data called motd and edit it to say whatever you want.  It is
  purely a text file and will be sent automatically to anyone logging in
  to the cluster.


  7.2.  Downtime message

  If for any reason the cluster is down, maybe for upgrade or
  maintenance but the machine is still running, a message can be sent to
  the user advising them of the fact.  This message lives in the
  /spider/data directory and is called "offline".  Simply create the
  file and edit it to say whatever you wish.  This file will be sent to
  a user attempting to log into the cluster when DXSpider is not
  actually running.


  7.3.  Other text messages

  You can set other text messages to be read by the user if they input
  the file name.  This could be for news items or maybe information for
  new users.  To set this up, make a directory under /spider called
  packclus.  Under this directory you can create files called news or
  newuser for example.  In fact you can create files with any names you
  like.  These can be listed by the user with the command ....


       show/files




  They can be read by the user by typing the command ....



       type news




  If the file they want to read is called news.  You could also set an
  alias for this in the Alias file to allow them just to type news


  You can also store other information in this directory, either
  directly or nested under directories.  One use for this would be to
  store DX bulletins such as the OPDX bulletins.  These can be listed
  and read by the user.  To keep things tidy, make a directory under
  /spider/packclus called bulletin.  Now copy any OPDX or similar
  bulletins into it.  These can be listed by the user in the same way as
  above using the show/files command with an extension for the bulletin
  directory you have just created, like this ....



       show/files bulletin





  An example would look like this ....



       sh/files
       bulletin      DIR 20-Dec-1999 1715Z news          1602 14-Dec-1999 1330Z




  You can see that in the files area (basically the packclus directory)
  there is a file called news and a directory called bulletin.  You can
  also see that dates they were created.  In the case of the file news,
  you can also see the time it was last modified, a good clue as to
  whether the file has been updated since you last read it.  To read the
  file called news you would simply issue the command ....



       type news




  To look what is in the bulletin directory you issue the command ....






  show/files bulletin
  opdx390      21381 29-Nov-1999 1621Z opdx390.1     1670 29-Nov-1999 1621Z

  You can now read any file in this directory using the type command,

  7.4.  The Aliases file

  You will find a file in /spider/cmd/ called Aliases.  First, copy this
  file to /spider/local_cmd/Aliases and edit this file.  You will see
  something like this ...

















  #!/usr/bin/perl

  # provide some standard aliases for commands for terminally
  # helpless ak1a user (helpless in the sense that they never
  # read nor understand help files)

  # This file is automagically reloaded if its modification time is
  # later than the one stored in CmdAlias.pm

  # PLEASE make this file consistant with reality! (the patterns MUST
  # match the filenames!)

  # Don't alter this file, copy it into the local_cmd tree and modify it.
  # This file will be replaced everytime I issue a new release.

  # You only need to put aliases in here for commands that don't work as
  # you desire naturally, e.g sh/dx on its own just works as you expect
  # so you need not add it as an alias.



  package CmdAlias;

          'y' => [
          ],
          'z' => [
          ],
  )




  You can create aliases for commands at will.  Beware though, these may
  not always turn out as you think.  Care is needed and you need to test
  the results once you have set an alias.


  7.5.  Console.pl

  In later versions of Spider a simple console program is provided for
  the sysop.  This has a type ahead buffer with line editing facilities
  and colour for spots, announces etc.  To use this program, simply use
  console.pl instead of client.


  To edit the colours, copy /spider/perl/Console.pl to /spider/local and
  edit the file with your favourite editor.


  7.6.  Updating kepler data

  Spider has a powerful and flexible show/satellite command.  In order
  for this to be accurate, the kepler data has to be updated regularly.
  In general, this data is available as an email or via cluster mail.
  Updating it is simple.  First you need to export the mail message as a
  file.  You do this with the export command from the cluster prompt as
  the sysop.  For example ...



       export 5467 /spider/perl/keps.in




  would export message number 5467 as a file called keps.in in the
  /spider/perl directory.

  Now login to a VT as sysop and cd /spider/perl.  There is a command in
  the perl directory called convkeps.pl.  All we need to do now is
  convert the file like so ...



       ./convkeps.pl keps.in




  Now go back to the cluster and issue the command ...



       load/keps




  That is it!  the kepler data has been updated.




  7.7.  The QRZ callbook

  The command sh/qrz will only work once you have followed a few simple
  steps.  First you need to get a user ID and password from qrz.com.
  Simply go to the site and create one.  Secondly you need to copy the
  file /spider/perl/Internet.pm to /spider/local and alter it to match
  your user ID and password.  You also at this point need to set
  $allow=1 to complete the setup.  Many thanks to Fred Lloyd, the
  proprieter of qrz.com for allowing this access.


  8.  CVS

  CVS stands for "Concurrent Versions System" and the CVS for DXSpider
  is held at Sourceforge.  This means that it is possible to update your
  DXSpider installation to the latest sources by using a few simple
  commands.


  THIS IS NOT FOR THE FAINT HEARTED!!!  ONLY DO THIS IF YOU HAVE A TEST
  INSTALLATION OR ARE WILLING TO HAVE YOUR CLUSTER CRASH ON YOU!!!  THIS
  MUST BE CONSIDERED AT LEAST BETA TESTING AND MAYBE EVEN ALPHA!!  YOU
  HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!


  DID I MENTION..... ONLY DO THIS IF YOU ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT THE
  CONSEQUENCES!!!


  I am of course assuming that you have a machine with both DXSpider and
  Internet access running.


  BEFORE YOU EVEN CONSIDER STARTING WITH THIS MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR
  ENTIRE SPIDER TREE!!


  Assuming you are connected to the Internet, you need to login to the
  CVS repository and then update your Spider source.  There are several
  steps which are listed below ...


  First login as the user sysop.  Next you need to connect to the CVS
  repository.  You do this with the command below ...


  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.DXSpider.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dxspider login



  You will get a password prompt.  Simply hit return here and your
  machine should return to a normal linux prompt.


  What happens next depends on whether you have an existing installation
  that you want to update with the latest and greatest or whether you
  just want to see what is there and/or run it on a new machine for
  testing.

  If you are installing Spider from CVS then change directory to
  /home/sysop

  If you are wanting to update Spider then cd to /tmp



  The next step will create a brand new 'spider' directory in your
  current directory.


  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.DXSpider.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dxspider co spider



  This command is all on one line.


  Hopefully your screen should show you downloading files.  The -z3
  simply compresses the download to improve speed.  When this has
  finished, you will have exactly the same as if you had untarred a full
  tarball PLUS some extra directories and files that CVS needs to do the
  magic that it does.


  Now if you are doing a new installation, that's it.  Carry on as if
  you have just downloaded and untarred the lastest tarball.


  If you want to upgrade your current installation then do this ...



       tar cvfz /tmp/s.tgz spider
       cd /
       tar xvfzp /tmp/s.tgz




  This is assuming you downloaded to the /tmp directory of course.


  NOTE:  the 'p' on the end of the 'xvfz' is IMPORTANT!   It keeps the
  permissions correct.  YOU WERE LOGGED IN AS THE USER SYSOP WEREN'T
  YOU?????

  Remember to recompile the C client (cd /spider/src; make)


  At this point the files have been upgraded.  You can (usually) restart
  the cluster in your own time.  However, if you attempt to use any new
  commands or features expect it to be fatal!  At least your cluster
  will have been restarted then so it will be too late to worry about
  it!


  Now the magic part!  From now on when you want to update, simply
  connect to the Internet and then, as the user sysop ...



       cd /spider
       cvs -z3 update -d




  and your files will be updated.  As above, remember to recompile the
  "C" client if it has been updated (CVS will tell you) and restart if
  any of the perl scripts have been altered or added, again, CVS will
  tell you.

  You will find any changes documented in the /spider/Changes file.


  9.  The DXSpider command set

  Below is a complete list of commands available from the cluster
  prompt.  Most maintenance tasks are automatic but there are some
  commands that are useful for a sysop.  These are listed below in
  alphabetical order.  The number in brackets following the command name
  is the permissions level needed to use the command.


  9.1.  accept/announce (0)

  accept/announce [0-9] <pattern> Set an accept filter line for announce


  Create an 'accept this announce' line for a filter.

  An accept filter line means that if the announce matches this filter
  it is passed onto the user. See HELP FILTERS for more info. Please
  read this to understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief
  later on.

  You can use any of the following things in this line:-



         info <string>            eg: iota or qsl
         by <prefixes>            eg: G,M,2
         origin <prefixes>
         origin_dxcc <numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
         origin_itu <numbers>
         origin_zone <numbers>
         by_dxcc <numbers>
         by_itu <numbers>
         by_zone <numbers>
         channel <prefixes>
         wx 1                     filter WX announces
         dest <prefixes>          eg: 6MUK,WDX      (distros)




  some examples:-



         acc/ann dest 6MUK
         acc/ann 2 by_zone 14,15,16
         (this could be all on one line: acc/ann dest 6MUK or by_zone 14,15,16)




  or



         acc/ann by G,M,2




  This filter would only allow announces that were posted buy UK
  stations.  You can use the tag 'all' to accept everything eg:
         acc/ann all




  but this probably for advanced users...


  9.2.  accept/announce (extended for sysops) (8)

  accept/announce <call> [input] [0-9]<pattern> Announce filter sysop
  version


  This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as
  the default for nodes and users eg:-



         accept/ann by G,M,2
         accept/ann input node_default by G,M,2
         accept/ann user_default by G,M,2





  9.3.  accept/spots (0)

  accept/announce [0-9] <pattern> Set an accept filter line for spots


  Create an 'accept this spot' line for a filter.


  An accept filter line means that if the spot matches this filter it is
  passed onto the user. See HELP FILTERS for more info. Please read this
  to understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief later on.

  You can use any of the following things in this line:-



         freq <range>           eg: 0/30000 or hf or hf/cw or 6m,4m,2m
         on <range>             same as 'freq'
         call <prefixes>        eg: G,PA,HB9
         info <string>          eg: iota or qsl
         by <prefixes>
         call_dxcc <numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
         call_itu <numbers>
         call_zone <numbers>
         by_dxcc <numbers>
         by_itu <numbers>
         by_zone <numbers>
         origin <prefixes>
         channel <prefixes>





  For frequencies, you can use any of the band names defined in
  SHOW/BANDS and you can use a subband name like: cw, rtty, data, ssb -
  thus: hf/ssb. You can also just have a simple range like: 0/30000 -
  this is more efficient than saying simply: freq HF (but don't get too
  hung up about that)
  some examples:-



         acc/spot 1 on hf/cw
         acc/spot 2 on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)




  You can use the tag 'all' to accept everything, eg:



         acc/spot 3 all




  but this probably for advanced users...


  9.4.  accept/spots (extended for sysops) (8)

  accept/spots <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> Spot filter sysop version


  This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as
  the default for nodes and users eg:-



         accept/spot db0sue-7 1 by_zone 14,15,16
         accept/spot node_default all
         set/hops node_default 10

         accept/spot user_default by G,M,2





  9.5.  accept/wcy (0)

  accept/wcy [0-9] <pattern> set an accept WCY filter


  It is unlikely that you will want to do this, but if you do then you
  can filter on the following fields:-



         by <prefixes>            eg: G,M,2
         origin <prefixes>
         origin_dxcc <numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
         origin_itu <numbers>
         origin_zone <numbers>
         by_dxcc <numbers>
         by_itu <numbers>
         by_zone <numbers>
         channel <prefixes>





  There are no examples because WCY Broadcasts only come from one place
  and you either want them or not (see UNSET/WCY if you don't want
  them).

  This command is really provided for future use.

  See HELP FILTER for information.


  9.6.  accept/wcy (extended for sysops) (8)

  accept/wcy <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> WCY filter sysop version


  This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as
  the default for nodes and users eg:-



         accept/wcy node_default all
         set/hops node_default 10





  9.7.  accept/wwv (0)

  accept/wwv [0-9] <pattern> Set an accept WWV filter


  It is unlikely that you will want to do this, but if you do then you
  can filter on the following fields:-



         by <prefixes>            eg: G,M,2
         origin <prefixes>
         origin_dxcc <numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
         origin_itu <numbers>
         origin_zone <numbers>
         by_dxcc <numbers>
         by_itu <numbers>
         by_zone <numbers>
         channel <prefixes>




  for example



         accept/wwv by_zone 4




  is probably the only useful thing to do (which will only show WWV
  broadcasts by stations in the US).

  See HELP FILTER for information.




  9.8.  accept/wwv (extended for sysops) (8)

  accept/wwv <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> WWV filter sysop version


  This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as
  the default for nodes and users eg:-



         accept/wwv db0sue-7 1 by_zone 4
         accept/wwv node_default all
         set/hops node_default 10

         accept/wwv user_default by W,K





  9.9.  announce (0)

  announce <text> Send an announcement to local users


  Send an announcement to LOCAL users only, where <text> is the text of
  the announcement you wish to broadcast


  9.10.  announce full (0)

  announce full <text> Send an announcement cluster wide


  This command will send your announcement across the whole cluster
  network.



  9.11.  announce sysop (5)

  announce sysop <text>


  Send an announcement to Sysops only


  9.12.  apropos (0)

  apropos <string> Search the help database


  Search the help database for <string> (it isn't case sensitive), and
  print the names of all the commands that may be relevant.


  9.13.  bye (0)

  bye Exit from the cluster


  This will disconnect you from the cluster




  9.14.  catchup (5)

  catchup <node_call> All|[<msgno> ...] Mark a message as sent


  When you send messages the fact that you have forwarded it to another
  node is remembered so that it isn't sent again. When you have a new
  partner node and you add their callsign to your /spider/msg/forward.pl
  file, all outstanding non-private messages will be forwarded to them.
  This may well be ALL the non-private messages. You can prevent this by
  using these commmands:-



         catchup GB7DJK all
         catchup GB7DJK 300 301 302 303 500-510




  and to undo what you have just done:-



         uncatchup GB7DJK all
         uncatchup GB7DJK 300 301 302 303 500-510




  which will arrange for them to be forward candidates again.

  Order is not important.


  9.15.  clear/spots (0)

  clear/spots [1|all] Clear a spot filter line


  This command allows you to clear (remove) a line in a spot filter or
  to remove the whole filter.

  If you have a filter:-



         acc/spot 1 on hf/cw
         acc/spot 2 on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)




  and you say:-



         clear/spot 1




  you will be left with:-



    acc/spot 2 on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)




  If you do:



         clear/spot all




  the filter will be completely removed.



  9.16.  connect (5)

  connect <callsign> Start a connection to another DX Cluster


  Start a connection process that will culminate in a new connection to
  the DX cluster <callsign>. This process creates a new 'client' process
  which will use the script in /spider/connect/<callsign> to effect the
  'chat' exchange necessary to traverse the network(s) to logon to the
  cluster <callsign>.


  9.17.  dbavail (0)

  dbavail Show a list of all the databases in the system


  The title says it all really, this command lists all the databases
  defined in the system. It is also aliased to SHOW/COMMAND.


  9.18.  dbcreate (9)

  dbcreate <name> Create a database entry
  dbcreate <name> chain <name> [<name>..] Create a chained database
  entry
  dbcreate <name> remote <node> Create a remote database entry


  DBCREATE allows you to define a database in the system. It doesn't
  actually create anything, just defines it.

  The databases that are created are simple DB_File hash databases, they
  are therefore already 'indexed'.

  You can define a local database with the first form of the command eg:

  DBCREATE oblast

  You can also chain databases with the addition of the 'chain' keyword.
  This will search each database one after the other. A typical example
  is:

  DBCREATE sdx_qsl chain sql_ad

  No checking is done to see if the any of the chained databases exist,
  in fact it is usually better to do the above statement first then do
  each of the chained databases.
  Databases can exist offsite. To define a database that lives on
  another node do:

  DBCREATE buckmaster remote gb7dxc

  Remote databases cannot be chained; however, the last database in a a
  chain can be a remote database eg:

  DBCREATE qsl chain gb7dxc

  To see what databases have been defined do:

  DBAVAIL (or it will have been aliased to SHOW/COMMAND)

  It would be normal for you to add an entry into your local Aliases
  file to allow people to use the 'SHOW/<dbname>' style syntax. So you
  would need to add a line like:-



         's' => [
           ..
           ..
           '^sh\w*/buc', 'dbshow buckmaster', 'dbshow',
           ..
           ..
          ],




  to allow

  SH/BUCK g1tlh

  to work as they may be used to.

  See DBIMPORT for the importing of existing AK1A format data to
  databases.  See DBSHOW for generic database enquiry


  9.19.  dbimport (9)

  dbimport <dbname> Import AK1A data into a database


  If you want to import or update data in bulk to a database you can use
  this command. It will either create or update entries into an existing
  database. For example:-

  DBIMPORT oblast /tmp/OBLAST.FUL

  will import the standard OBLAST database that comes with AK1A into the
  oblast database held locally.


  9.20.  dbremove (9)

  dbremove <dbname> Delete a database


  DBREMOVE will completely remove a database entry and also delete any
  data file that is associated with it.

  There is no warning, no comeback, no safety net.

  For example:

  DBREMOVE oblast

  will remove the oblast database from the system and it will also
  remove the associated datafile.

  I repeat:

  There is no warning, no comeback, no safety net.

  You have been warned.


  9.21.  dbshow (0)

  dbshow <dbname> <key> Display an entry, if it exists, in a database


  This is the generic user interface to the database to the database
  system.  It is expected that the sysop will add an entry to the local
  Aliases file so that users can use the more familiar AK1A style of
  enquiry such as:



         SH/BUCK G1TLH




  but if he hasn't and the database really does exist (use DBAVAIL or
  SHOW/COMMAND to find out) you can do the same thing with:



         DBSHOW buck G1TLH






  9.22.  debug (9)

  debug Set the cluster program into debug mode


  Executing this command will only have an effect if you are running the
  cluster in debug mode i.e.



               perl -d cluster.pl




  It will interrupt the cluster just after the debug command has
  finished.


  9.23.  directory (0)

  directory List messages
  directory own List your own messages
  directory new List all new messages
  directory to <call> List all messages to <call>
  directory from <call> List all messages from <call>
  directory subject <string> List all messages with <string> in subject
  directory <nn> List last <nn> messages
  directory <from>-<to> List messages <from> message <to> message


  List the messages in the messages directory.

  If there is a 'p' one space after the message number then it is a
  personal message. If there is a '-' between the message number and the

  You can use shell escape characters such as '*' and '?' in the <call>
  fields.

  You can combine some of the various directory commands together eg:-



          DIR TO G1TLH 5
       or
          DIR SUBJECT IOTA 200-250




  You can abbreviate all the commands to one letter and use ak1a
  syntax:-



          DIR/T G1* 10
          DIR/S QSL 10-100 5






  9.24.  directory (extended for sysops) (5)

  Works just like the user command except that sysops can see ALL
  messages.


  9.25.  disconnect (8)

  disconnect <call> [<call> ...] Disconnect a user or node


  Disconnect any <call> connected locally


  9.26.  dx (0)

  dx [by <call>] <freq> <call> <remarks> Send a DX spot


  This is how you send a DX Spot to other users. You can, in fact, now
  enter the <freq> and the <call> either way round.





     DX FR0G 144.600
     DX 144.600 FR0G
     DX 144600 FR0G




  will all give the same result. You can add some remarks to the end of
  the command and they will be added to the spot.



          DX FR0G 144600 this is a test




  You can credit someone else by saying:-



          DX by G1TLH FR0G 144.600 he isn't on the cluster




  The <freq> is compared against the available bands set up in the
  cluster.  See SHOW/BANDS for more information.


  9.27.  export (9)

  export <msgno> <filename> Export a message to a file


  Export a message to a file. This command can only be executed on a
  local console with a fully privileged user. The file produced will be
  in a form ready to be imported back into the cluster by placing it in
  the import directory (/spider/msg/import).

  This command cannot overwrite an existing file. This is to provide
  some measure of security. Any files written will owned by the same
  user as the main cluster, otherwise you can put the new files anywhere
  the cluster can access. For example:-

  EXPORT 2345 /tmp/a


  9.28.  export_users (9)

  export_users [<filename>] Export the users database to ascii


  Export the users database to a file in ascii format. If no filename is
  given then it will export the file to /spider/data/user_asc.

  If the file already exists it will be renamed to <filename>.o. In fact
  up to 5 generations of the file can be kept each one with an extra 'o'
  on the suffix.

  BE WARNED: this will write to any file you have write access to. No
  check is made on the filename (if any) that you specify.




  9.29.  forward/latlong (8)

  forward/latlong <node_call> Send latitude and longitude information to
  another cluster


  This command sends all the latitude and longitude information that
  your cluster is holding against callsigns.  One advantage of recieving
  this information is that more locator information is held by you.
  This means that more locators are given on the DX line assuming you
  have set/dxgrid enabled.  This could be a LOT of information though,
  so it is not recommended on slow links.


  9.30.  forward/opername (1)

  forward/opername <call> Send out information on this <call> to all
  clusters


  This command sends out any information held in the user file which can
  be broadcast in PC41 protocol packets. This information is Name, QTH,
  Location and Homenode. PC41s are only sent for the information that is
  available.


  9.31.  help (0)

  help <cmd> Get help on a command


  All commands can be abbreviated, so SHOW/DX can be abbreviated to
  SH/DX, ANNOUNCE can be shortened to AN and so on.

  Look at the APROPOS <string> command which will search the help
  database for the <string> you specify and give you a list of likely
  commands to look at with HELP.


  9.32.  init (5)

  init <node call> Re-initialise a link to an AK1A compatible node


  This command attempts to re-initialise a link to a (usually) AK1A node
  that has got confused, usually by a protocol loop of some kind. It may
  work - but you usually will be better off simply disconnecting it (or
  better, if it is a real AK1A node, doing an RCMD <node> DISC/F <your
  node>).

  Best of luck - you will need it.


  9.33.  kill (0)

  kill <msgno> [<msgno> ..] Delete a message from the local system


  Delete a message from the local system. You will only be able to
  delete messages that you have originated or been sent (unless you are
  the sysop).





  9.34.  kill (5)

  kill <msgno> [<msgno> ...] Remove or erase a message from the system
  kill from <call> Remove all messages from a callsign
  kill to <call> Remove all messages to a callsign


  You can get rid of any message to or originating from your callsign
  using this command. You can remove more than one message at a time.

  As a sysop you can kill any message on the system.


  9.35.  kill full (5)

  kill full <msgno> [<msgno>] Delete a message from the whole cluster


  Delete a message (usually a 'bulletin') from the whole cluster system.

  This uses the subject field, so any messages that have exactly the
  same subject will be deleted. Beware!


  9.36.  links (0)

  links Show which nodes are physically connected


  This is a quick listing that shows which links are connected and some
  information about them. See WHO for a list of all connections.



  9.37.  load/aliases (9)

  load/aliases Reload the command alias table


  Reload the /spider/cmd/Aliases file after you have editted it. You
  will need to do this if you change this file whilst the cluster is
  running in order for the changes to take effect.



  9.38.  load/baddx (9)

  load/baddx Reload the bad DX table


  Reload the /spider/data/baddx.pl file if you have changed it manually
  whilst the cluster is running. This table contains the DX Calls that,
  if spotted, will not be passed on. FR0G and TEST are classic examples.


  9.39.  load/badmsg (9)

  load/badmsg Reload the bad message table


  Reload the /spider/msg/badmsg.pl file if you have changed it manually
  whilst the cluster is running. This table contains a number of perl
  regular expressions which are searched for in the fields targetted of
  each message.  If any of them match then that message is immediately
  deleted on receipt.

  9.40.  load/badwords (9)

  load/badwords Reload the badwords file


  Reload the /spider/data/badwords file if you have changed it manually
  whilst the cluster is running. This file contains a list of words
  which, if found on certain text portions of PC protocol, will cause
  those protocol frames to be rejected. It will all put out a message if
  any of these words are used on the announce, dx and talk commands. The
  words can be one or more on a line, lines starting with '#' are
  ignored.


  9.41.  load/bands (9)

  load/bands Reload the band limits table


  Reload the /spider/data/bands.pl file if you have changed it manually
  whilst the cluster is running.


  9.42.  load/cmd_cache (9)

  load/cmd_cache Reload the automatic command cache


  Normally, if you change a command file in the cmd or local_cmd tree it
  will automatially be picked up by the cluster program. Sometimes it
  can get confused if you are doing a lot of moving commands about or
  delete a command in the local_cmd tree and want to use the normal one
  again. Execute this command to reset everything back to the state it
  was just after a cluster restart.


  9.43.  load/forward (9)

  load/forward Reload the msg forwarding routing table

  Reload the /spider/msg/forward.pl file if you have changed it manually
  whilst the cluster is running.


  9.44.  load/messages (9)

  load/messages Reload the system messages file


  If you change the /spider/perl/Messages file (usually whilst
  fiddling/writing ne commands) you can have them take effect during a
  cluster session by executing this command. You need to do this if get
  something like :-

  unknown message 'xxxx' in lang 'en'


  9.45.  load/prefixes (9)

  load/prefixes Reload the prefix table


  Reload the /spider/data/prefix_data.pl file if you have changed it
  manually whilst the cluster is running.


  9.46.  merge (5)

  merge <node> [<no spots>/<no wwv>] Ask for the latest spots and WWV


  MERGE allows you to bring your spot and wwv database up to date. By
  default it will request the last 10 spots and 5 WWVs from the node you
  select. The node must be connected locally.

  You can request any number of spots or wwv and although they will be
  appended to your databases they will not duplicate any that have
  recently been added (the last 2 days for spots and last month for WWV
  data).


  9.47.  msg (9)

  msg <cmd> <msgno> [data ...] Alter various message parameters


  Alter message parameters like To, From, Subject, whether private or
  bulletin or return receipt (RR) is required or whether to keep this
  message from timing out.



         MSG TO <msgno> <call>     - change TO callsign to <call>
         MSG FRom <msgno> <call>   - change FROM callsign to <call>
         MSG PRrivate <msgno>      - set private flag
         MSG NOPRrivate <msgno>    - unset private flag
         MSG RR <msgno>            - set RR flag
         MSG NORR <msgno>          - unset RR flag
         MSG KEep <msgno>          - set the keep flag (message won't be deleted ever)
         MSG NOKEep <msgno>        - unset the keep flag
         MSG SUbject <msgno> <new> - change the subject to <new>
         MSG WAittime <msgno>      - remove any waitting time for this message
         MSG NOREad <msgno>        - mark message as unread
         MSG REad <msgno>          - mark message as read
         MSG QUeue                 - queue any outstanding bulletins
         MSG QUeue 1               - queue any outstanding private messages




  You can look at the status of a message by using:-

  STAT/MSG <msgno>

  This will display more information on the message than DIR does.


  9.48.  pc (8)

  pc <call> <text> Send text (eg PC Protocol) to <call>


  Send some arbitrary text to a locally connected callsign. No
  processing is done on the text. This command allows you to send PC
  Protocol to unstick things if problems arise (messages get stuck etc).
  eg:-

  pc gb7djk PC33^GB7TLH^GB7DJK^400^

  You can also use in the same way as a talk command to a connected user
  but without any processing, added of "from <blah> to <blah>" or
  whatever.
  pc G1TLH Try doing that properly!!!


  9.49.  ping (1)

  ping <node> Check the link quality between nodes


  his command allows you to send a frame to another cluster node on the
  network and get a return frame.  The time it takes to do this is a
  good indication of the quality of the link.  The actual time it takes
  is output to the console in seconds.  Any visible cluster node can be
  PINGed.



  9.50.  rcmd (1)

  rcmd <node call> <cmd> Send a command to another DX cluster


  This command allows you to send nearly any command to another DX
  Cluster node that is connected to the system.

  Whether you get any output is dependant on a) whether the other system
  knows that the node callsign of this cluster is in fact a node b)
  whether the other system is allowing RCMDs from this node and c)
  whether you have permission to send this command at all.


  9.51.  read (0)

  read Read the next unread personal message addressed to you
  read <msgno> Read the specified message


  You can read any messages that are sent as 'non-personal' and also any
  message either sent by or sent to your callsign.



  9.52.  read (extended for sysops) (5)

  read <msgno> Read a message on the system


  As a sysop you may read any message on the system


  9.53.  reject/announce

  reject/announce [0-9] <pattern> Set a reject filter for announce


  Create an 'reject this announce' line for a filter.

  An reject filter line means that if the announce matches this filter
  it is passed onto the user. See HELP FILTERS for more info. Please
  read this to understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief
  later on.

  You can use any of the following things in this line:-




    info <string>            eg: iota or qsl
    by <prefixes>            eg: G,M,2
    origin <prefixes>
    origin_dxcc <numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
    origin_itu <numbers>
    origin_zone <numbers>
    by_dxcc <numbers>
    by_itu <numbers>
    by_zone <numbers>
    channel <prefixes>
    wx 1                     filter WX announces
    dest <prefixes>          eg: 6MUK,WDX      (distros)




  some examples:-



         rej/ann by_zone 14,15,16 and not by G,M,2




  You can use the tag 'all' to reject everything eg:



         rej/ann all




  but this probably for advanced users...


  9.54.  reject/announce (extended for sysops) (8)

  reject/announce <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> Announce filter sysop
  version


  This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as
  the default for nodes and users eg:-



         reject/ann by G,M,2
         reject/ann input node_default by G,M,2
         reject/ann user_default by G,M,2





  9.55.  reject/spots (0)

  reject/spots [0-9] <pattern> Set a reject filter line for spots


  Create a 'reject this spot' line for a filter.

  A reject filter line means that if the spot matches this filter it is
  dumped (not passed on). See HELP FILTERS for more info. Please read
  this to understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief
  later on.

  You can use any of the following things in this line:-



         freq <range>           eg: 0/30000 or hf or hf/cw or 6m,4m,2m
         on <range>             same as 'freq'
         call <prefixes>        eg: G,PA,HB9
         info <string>          eg: iota or qsl
         by <prefixes>
         call_dxcc <numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
         call_itu <numbers>
         call_zone <numbers>
         by_dxcc <numbers>
         by_itu <numbers>
         by_zone <numbers>
         origin <prefixes>
         channel <prefixes>




  For frequencies, you can use any of the band names defined in
  SHOW/BANDS and you can use a subband name like: cw, rtty, data, ssb -
  thus: hf/ssb. You can also just have a simple range like: 0/30000 -
  this is more efficient than saying simply: on HF (but don't get too
  hung up about that)

  some examples:-



         rej/spot 1 on hf
         rej/spot 2 on vhf and not (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)




  You can use the tag 'all' to reject everything eg:



         rej/spot 3 all




  but this probably for advanced users...


  9.56.  reject/spots (extended for sysops) (8)

  reject/spots <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> Reject spot filter sysop
  version


  This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as
  the default for nodes and users eg:-







    reject/spot db0sue-7 1 by_zone 14,15,16
    reject/spot node_default all
    set/hops node_default 10

    reject/spot user_default by G,M,2





  9.57.  reject/wcy (0)

  reject/wcy [0-9] <pattern> Set a reject WCY filter


  It is unlikely that you will want to do this, but if you do then you
  can filter on the following fields:-



         by <prefixes>            eg: G,M,2
         origin <prefixes>
         origin_dxcc <numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
         origin_itu <numbers>
         origin_zone <numbers>
         by_dxcc <numbers>
         by_itu <numbers>
         by_zone <numbers>
         channel <prefixes>




  There are no examples because WCY Broadcasts only come from one place
  and you either want them or not (see UNSET/WCY if you don't want
  them).

  This command is really provided for future use.

  See HELP FILTER for information.


  9.58.  reject/wcy (extended for sysops) (8)

  reject/wcy <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> WCY reject filter sysop
  version


  This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as
  the default for nodes and users eg:-

  reject/wcy gb7djk all


  9.59.  reject/wwv (0)

  reject/wwv [0-9] <pattern> Set a reject WWV filter


  It is unlikely that you will want to do this, but if you do then you
  can filter on the following fields:-





    by <prefixes>            eg: G,M,2
    origin <prefixes>
    origin_dxcc <numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)
    origin_itu <numbers>
    origin_zone <numbers>
    by_dxcc <numbers>
    by_itu <numbers>
    by_zone <numbers>
    channel <prefixes>




  for example



         reject/wwv by_zone 14,15,16




  is probably the only useful thing to do (which will only show WWV
  broadcasts by stations in the US).

  See HELP FILTER for information.


  9.60.  reject/wwv (extended for sysops) (8)

  reject/wwv <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> WWV reject filter sysop
  version


  This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as
  the default for nodes and users eg:-



         reject/wwv db0sue-7 1 by_zone 4
         reject/wwv node_default all

         reject/wwv user_default by W





  9.61.  reply (0)

  reply <msgno> Reply (privately) to the specified message
  reply B <msgno> Reply as a Bulletin to the specified message
  reply NOPrivate <msgno> Reply as a Bulletin to the specified message
  reply RR <msgno> Reply to the specified message with read receipt


  You can reply to a message and the subject will automatically have
  "Re:" inserted in front of it, if it isn't already present.

  You can also use all the extra qualifiers such as RR, PRIVATE,
  NOPRIVATE, B that you can use with the SEND command (see SEND for
  further details)



  9.62.  send (0)

  send <call> [<call> ...] Send a message to one or more callsigns
  send RR <call> Send a message and ask for a read receipt
  send COPY <msgno> <call> Send a copy of a  message to someone
  send PRIVATE <call> Send a personal message
  send NOPRIVATE <call> Send a message to all stations


  All the SEND commands will create a message which will be sent either
  to an individual callsign or to one of the 'bulletin' addresses.

  SEND <call> on its own acts as though you had typed SEND PRIVATE, that
  is it will mark the message as personal and send it to the cluster
  node that that callsign is connected to.

  You can have more than one callsign in all of the SEND commands.

  You can have multiple qualifiers so that you can have for example:-



         SEND RR COPY 123 PRIVATE G1TLH G0RDI




  which should send a copy of message 123 to G1TLH and G0RDI and you
  will receive a read receipt when they have read the message.

  SB is an alias for SEND NOPRIVATE (or send a bulletin in BBS speak) SP
  is an alias for SEND PRIVATE


  9.63.  set/address (0)

  set/address <your_address> Record your postal address


  Literally, record your address details on the cluster.

  9.66.  set/baddx (8)

  set/baddx <call> Stop words we do not wish to see in the callsign
  field of a dx spot being propagated



  Setting a word as 'baddx' will prevent spots with that word in the
  callsign field of a DX spot from going any further. They will not be
  displayed and they will not be sent onto other nodes.

  The word must be wriiten in full, no wild cards are allowed eg:-



         set/baddx FORSALE VIDEO FR0G




  To allow a word again, use the following command ...



         unset/baddx VIDEO





  9.67.  set/badnode (6)

  set/badnode <node_call> Stop spots from this node_call being
  propagated


  Setting a callsign as a 'badnode' will prevent spots from that node
  going any further. They will not be displayed and they will not be
  sent onto other nodes.

  The call can be a full or partial call (or a prefix), eg:-



         set/badnode K1TTT




  will stop anything from K1TTT (including any SSID's)



         unset/badnode K1TTT




  will allow spots from him again.

  Use with extreme care. This command may well be superceded by
  FILTERing.


  9.68.  set/badspotter (8)

  set/badspotter <call> Stop spots from this callsign being propagated


  Setting a callsign as a 'badspotter' will prevent spots from this
  callsign going any further. They will not be displayed and they will
  not be sent onto other nodes.

  The call must be written in full, no wild cards are allowed eg:-



         set/badspotter VE2STN




  will stop anything from VE2STN. If you want SSIDs as well then you
  must enter them specifically.



         unset/badspotter VE2STN




  will allow spots from him again.

  Use with extreme care. This command may well be superceded by
  FILTERing.


  9.69.  set/beep (0)

  set/beep Add beeps to terminal messages


  Add a beep to DX and other terminal messages.


  9.70.  set/clx (5)

  set/clx <node_call> [<node_call> ...] Make the node_call a CLX type
  node


  Set the node_call as a CLX type node


  9.71.  set/debug (9)

  set/debug <name> Add a debug level to the debug set


  You can choose to log several different levels.  The levels are

  chan state msg cron connect

  You can show what levels you are logging with the show/debug command.

  You can remove a debug level with unset/debug <name>


  9.72.  set/dx (0)

  set/dxAllow DX messages to arrive at your terminal


  You can stop DX messages with the unset/dx command




  9.73.  set/dxgrid (0)

  set/dxgridAllow grid squares on the end of DX messages


  Some logging programs do not like the additional information at the
  end of a DX spot.  If this is the case, use the unset/dxgrid command
  to remove the grid squares.


  9.74.  set/dxnet (5)

  set/dxnet <node_call> [<node_call> ...] Make the node_call a DXNet
  type node


  Set the node_call as a DXNet type node


  9.75.  set/echo (0)

  set/echo Make the cluster echo your input


  If you are connected via a telnet session, different implimentations
  of telnet handle echo differently depending on whether you are
  connected via port 23 or some other port. You can use this command to
  change the setting appropriately.

  You can remove the echo with the unset/echo command

  The setting is stored in your user profile.

  YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE THIS COMMAND IF YOU ARE CONNECTED VIA AX25.


  9.76.  set/here (0)

  set/here Set the here flag


  Let others on the cluster know you are here by only displaying your
  callsign.  If you are away from your terminal you can use the
  unset/here command to let people know you are away.  This simply puts
  brackets around your callsign to indicate you are not available.


  9.77.  set/homenode (0)

  set/homenode <node_call> Set your home cluster


  Tell the cluster system where you normally connect to. Any Messages
  sent to you will normally find their way there should you not be
  connected.  eg:-



         SET/HOMENODE gb7djk







  9.78.  set/hops (8)

  set/hops <node_call> ann|spots|wwv|wcy <n> Set hop count


  Set the hop count for a particular type of broadcast for a node.

  This command allows you to set up special hop counts for a node for
  currently: announce, spots, wwv and wcy broadcasts.



       eg:
         set/hops gb7djk ann 10
         set/hops gb7mbc spots 20




  Set SHOW/HOPS for information on what is already set. This command
  creates a filter and works in conjunction with the filter system.


  9.79.  set/isolate (9)

  set/isolate <node call> Isolate a node from the rest of the network


  Connect a node to your system in such a way that you are a full
  protocol member of its network and can see all spots on it, but
  nothing either leaks out from it nor goes back into from the rest of
  the nodes connected to you.

  You can potentially connect several nodes in this way.

  You can see which nodes are isolated with the show/isolate (1)
  command.

  You can remove the isolation with the command unset/isolate.


  9.80.  set/language (0)

  set/language <language> Set the language you wish to use


  You can select the language that you want the cluster to use.
  Currently the languages available are en (English) and nl (Dutch).


  9.81.  set/location (0)

  set/location <lat and long> Set your latitude and longitude


  You can set your latitude and longitude manually or alternatively use
  the set/qra command which will do the conversion for you.



         set/location 54 04 N 2 02 E





  9.82.  set/sys_location (9)

  set/sys_location <lat & long> Set your cluster latitude and longitude


  In order to get accurate headings and such like you must tell the
  system what your latitude and longitude is. If you have not yet done a
  SET/QRA then this command will set your QRA locator for you. For
  example:-



         SET/LOCATION 52 22 N 0 57 E





  9.83.  set/logininfo (0)

  set/logininfo Show logins and logouts of nodes and users


  Show users and nodes when they log in and out of the local cluster.
  You can stop these messages by using the unset/logininfo command.



  9.84.  set/lockout (9)

  set/lockout <call> Stop a callsign connecting to the cluster


  You can show who is locked out with the show/lockout command.  To
  allow the user to connect again, use the unset/lockout command.


  9.85.  set/name (0)

  set/name <your_name> Set your name


  Tell the cluster what your name is, eg:-



         set/name Dirk





  9.86.  set/node (9)

  set/node <call> [<call> ...] Make the callsign an AK1A cluster


  Tell the system that the call(s) are to be treated as AK1A cluster and
  fed PC Protocol rather normal user commands.

  From version 1.41 you can also set the following types of cluster





    set/spider
    set/dxnet
    set/clx
    set/arcluster




  To see what your nodes are set to, use the show/nodes command.


  9.87.  set/obscount (9)

  set/obscount <count> <node call> Set the 'pump-up' obsolescence
  counter


  From version 1.35 onwards neighbouring nodes are pinged at regular
  intervals (see SET/PINGINTERVAL), usually 300 seconds or 5 minutes.
  There is a 'pump-up' counter which is decremented on every outgoing
  ping and then reset to the 'obscount' value on every incoming ping.
  The default value of this parameter is 2.

  What this means is that a neighbouring node will be pinged twice at
  (default) 300 second intervals and if no reply has been heard just
  before what would be the third attempt, that node is disconnected.

  If a ping is heard then the obscount is reset to the full value. Using
  default values, if a node has not responded to a ping within 15
  minutes, it is disconnected.


  9.88.  set/page (0)

  set/page <n> Set the number of lines per page


  Tell the system how many lines you wish on a page when the number of
  lines of output from a command is more than this. The default is 20.
  Setting it explicitly to 0 will disable paging.



         SET/PAGE 30
         SET/PAGE 0




  The setting is stored in your user profile.



  9.89.  set/password (9)

  set/password <callsign> <string> Set a users password


  The password for a user can only be set by a full sysop. The string
  can contain any characters but any spaces are removed (you can type in
  spaces - but they won't appear in the password). You can see the
  result with STAT/USER.  The password is the usual 30 character baycom
  type password.



  9.90.  set/pinginterval (9)

  set/pinginterval <time> <node call> Set the ping time to neighbouring
  nodes


  As from version 1.35 all neighbouring nodes are pinged at regular
  intervals in order to determine the rolling quality of the link and,
  in future, to affect routing decisions. The default interval is 300
  secs or 5 minutes.

  You can use this command to set a different interval. Please don't.

  But if you do the value you enter is treated as minutes up 60 and
  seconds for numbers greater than that.

  This is used also to help determine when a link is down at the far end
  (as certain cluster software doesn't always notice), see SET/OBSCOUNT
  for more information.


  9.91.  set/privilege (9)

  set/privilege <n> <call> [<call> ...] Set the privilege level on a
  call


  Set the privilege level on a callsign. The privilege levels that
  pertain to commands are as default:-



         0 - normal user
         1 - allow remote nodes normal user RCMDs
         5 - various privileged commands (including shutdown, but not disc-
             connect), the normal level for another node.
         8 - more privileged commands (including disconnect)
         9 - local sysop privilege. DO NOT SET ANY REMOTE USER OR NODE TO THIS
             LEVEL.




  If you are a sysop and you come in as a normal user on a remote
  connection your privilege will automatically be set to 0.


  9.92.  set/spider (5)

  set/spider <node_call> [<node_call> ...] Make the node_call a DXSpider
  type node


  Set the node_call as a DXSpider type node


  9.93.  set/sys_qra (9)

  set/sys_qra <locator> Set your cluster QRA locator


  9.94.  set/qra (0)

  set/qra <locator> Set your QRA locator


  Tell the system what your QRA (or Maidenhead) locator is. If you have
  not done a SET/LOCATION then your latitude and longitude will be set
  roughly correctly (assuming your locator is correct ;-). For example:-



         SET/QRA JO02LQ





  9.95.  set/qth (0)

  set/qth <your QTH> Set your QTH


  Tell the system where your are.  For example:-



         set/qth East Dereham, Norfolk





  9.96.  set/talk (0)

  WCY messages with the unset/wcy command.


  9.98.  set/wwv (0)

  set/wwv Allow WWV messages to be seen at your console


  Allow WWV information to be seen at your console.  You can switch off
  WWV messages with the unset/wwv command.


  9.99.  set/wx (0)

  show/configuration [<node>] Show all visible nodes and their users


  This command allows you to see all the users that can be seen and the
  nodes to which they are connected.  With the optional node, you can
  specify a particular node to look at.

  9.104.  show/configuration/node (0)

  show/configuration/node Show all the nodes connected


  Show all the nodes connected locally and the nodes they have
  connected.


  9.105.  show/connect (1)

  This command shows information on all the active connections known to
  the node. This command gives slightly more information than WHO.


  9.106.  show/date (0)

  show/date [<prefix>|<callsign>] Show the local time


  This is very nearly the same as SHOW/TIME, the only difference the
  format of the date string if no arguments are given.
  If no prefixes or callsigns are given then this command returns the
  local time and UTC as the computer has it right now. If you give some
  prefixes then it will show UTC and UTC + the local offset (not
  including DST) at the prefixes or callsigns that you specify.


  9.107.  show/debug (9)

  show/debug Show what levels of debug you are logging


  The levels can be set with set/debug


  9.108.  show/dx (0)

  show/dx [options] interrogate the spot database


  If you just type SHOW/DX you will get the last so many spots (sysop
  configurable, but usually 10).

  In addition you can add any number of these options in very nearly any
  order to the basic SHOW/DX command, they are:-




       on <band>       - eg 160m 20m 2m 23cm 6mm
       on <region>     - eg hf vhf uhf shf      (see SHOW/BANDS)

       <number>        - the number of spots you want
       <from>-<to>     - <from> spot no <to> spot no in
                         the selected list

       <prefix>        - for a spotted callsign beginning with <prefix>
       *<suffix>       - for a spotted callsign ending in <suffix>
       *<string>*      - for a spotted callsign containing <string>

       day <number>    - starting <number> days ago
       day <from>-<to> - <from> days <to> days ago

       info <text>     - any spots containing <text> in the info or remarks

       by <call>       - any spots spotted by <call> (spotter <call>
                               is the same).

       qsl             - this automatically looks for any qsl info on the call
                         held in the spot database.

       iota [<iota>]   - If the iota island number is missing it will
                         look for the string iota and anything which looks like
                         an iota island number. If you specify then it will look
                         for that island.

       qra [<locator>] - this will look for the specific locator if
                         you specify one or else anything that looks like a locator.




  e.g.




     SH/DX 9m0
     SH/DX on 20m info iota
     SH/DX 9a on vhf day 30
     SH/DX rf1p qsl
     SH/DX iota
     SH/DX iota eu-064
     SH/DX qra jn86





  9.109.  show/dxcc (0)

  show/dxcc <prefix> Interrogate the spot database by country


  This command takes the <prefix> (which can be a full or partial
  callsign if desired), looks up which internal country number it is and
  then displays all the spots as per SH/DX for that country.

  The options for SHOW/DX also apply to this command.  e.g.




          SH/DXCC G
          SH/DXCC W on 20m info iota





  9.110.  show/files (0)

  show/files [<filearea> [<string>]] List the contents of a filearea


  SHOW/FILES on its own will show you a list of the various fileareas
  available on the system. To see the contents of a particular file area
  type:-



          SH/FILES <filearea>




  where <filearea> is the name of the filearea you want to see the
  contents of.

  You can also use shell globbing characters like '*' and '?' in a
  string to see a selection of files in a filearea eg:-



          SH/FILES bulletins arld*




  See also TYPE - to see the contents of a file.



  9.111.  show/filter (0)

  show/filter Show the filters you have set


  Show the contents of all the filters that are set by you. This command
  displays all the filters set - for all the various categories.

  A sysop can look at any filters that have been set.


  9.113.  show/hops (8)

  show/hops <node_call> [ann|spots|wcy|wwv|] Show the hop counts for a
  node


  This command shows the hop counts set up for a node. You can specify
  which category you want to see. If you leave the category out then all
  the categories will be listed.


  9.114.  show/isolate (1)

  show/isolate Show a list of isolated nodes


  Show which nodes are currently set to be isolated.


  9.115.  show/lockout (9)

  show/lockout Show a list of excluded callsigns


  Show a list of callsigns that have been excluded (locked out) of the
  cluster locally with the set/lockout command


  9.116.  show/log (8)

  show/log [<callsign>] Show excerpts from the system log


  This command outputs a short section of the system log.  On its own it
  will output a general logfile.  With the optional callsign it will
  show output from the log associated with that callsign.


  9.117.  show/moon (0)

  show/moon [<prefix>|<callsign>] Show moon rise and set times


  Show the Moon rise and set times for a (list of) prefixes or
  callsigns, together with the azimuth and elevation of the sun
  currently at those locations.

  If you don't specify any prefixes or callsigns, it will show the times
  for your QTH (assuming you have set it with either SET/LOCATION or
  SET/QRA), together with the current azimuth and elevation.

  In addition, it will show the gain or loss dB relative to the nominal
  distance of 385,000Km due to the ellipsoidal nature of the orbit.

  If all else fails it will show the Moonrise and set times for the node
  that you are connected to.

  For example:-



         SH/MOON
         SH/MOON G1TLH W5UN





  9.118.  show/muf (0)

  show/muf <prefix> [<hours>][long] Show the likely propagation to
  <prefix>


  This command allow you to estimate the likelihood of you contacting a
  station with the prefix you have specified. The output assumes a
  modest power of 20dBW and receiver sensitivity of -123dBm (about
  0.15muV/10dB SINAD)

  The result predicts the most likely operating frequencies and signal
  levels for high frequency (shortwave) radio propagation paths on
  specified days of the year and hours of the day. It is most useful for
  paths between 250 km and 6000 km, but can be used with reduced
  accuracy for paths shorter or longer than this.

  The command uses a routine MINIMUF 3.5 developed by the U.S. Navy and
  used to predict the MUF given the predicted flux, day of the year,
  hour of the day and geographic coordinates of the transmitter and
  receiver. This routine is reasonably accurate for the purposes here,
  with a claimed RMS error of 3.8 MHz, but much smaller and less complex
  than the programs used by major shortwave broadcasting organizations,
  such as the Voice of America.

  The command will display some header information detailing its
  assumptions, together with the locations, latitude and longitudes and
  bearings. It will then show UTC (UT), local time at the other end
  (LT), calculate the MUFs, Sun zenith angle at the midpoint of the path
  (Zen) and the likely signal strengths. Then for each frequency for
  which the system thinks there is a likelihood of a circuit it prints a
  value.

  The value is currently a likely S meter reading based on the
  conventional 6dB / S point scale. If the value has a '+' appended it
  means that it is 1/2 an S point stronger. If the value is preceeded by
  an 'm' it means that there is likely to be much fading and by an 's'
  that the signal is likely to be noisy.

  By default SHOW/MUF will show the next two hours worth of data. You
  can specify anything up to 24 hours worth of data by appending the no
  of hours required after the prefix. For example:-



         SH/MUF W

  produces:



         RxSens: -123 dBM SFI: 159   R: 193   Month: 10   Day: 21
         Power :   20 dBW    Distance:  6283 km    Delay: 22.4 ms
         Location                       Lat / Long           Azim
         East Dereham, Norfolk          52 41 N 0 57 E         47
         United-States-W                43 0 N 87 54 W        299
         UT LT  MUF Zen  1.8  3.5  7.0 10.1 14.0 18.1 21.0 24.9 28.0 50.0
         18 23 11.5 -35  mS0+ mS2   S3
         19  0 11.2 -41  mS0+ mS2   S3




  indicating that you will have weak, fading circuits on top band and
  80m but usable signals on 40m (about S3).

  inputing:-



         SH/MUF W 24




  will get you the above display, but with the next 24 hours worth of
  propagation data.



         SH/MUF W L 24
         SH/MUF W 24 Long




  Gives you an estimate of the long path propagation characterics. It
  should be noted that the figures will probably not be very useful, nor
  terrible accurate, but it is included for completeness.


  9.119.  show/node (1)

  show/node [<node_call> ...] Show the type and version number of nodes


  Show the type and version (if connected) of the nodes specified on the
  command line. If no callsigns are specified then a sorted list of all
  the non-user callsigns known to the system will be displayed.


  9.120.  show/prefix (0)

  show/prefix <callsign> Interrogate the prefix database


  This command takes the <callsign> (which can be a full or partial
  callsign or a prefix), looks up which internal country number it is
  and then displays all the relevant prefixes for that country together
  with the internal country no, the CQ and ITU regions.

  See also SHOW/DXCC

  9.121.  show/program (5)

  show/program Show the locations of all the included program modules


  Show the name and location where every program module was load from.
  This is useful for checking where you think you have loaded a .pm file
  from.


  9.122.  show/qra (0)

  show/qra <locator> [<locator>] Show the distance between locators
  show/qra <lat> <long> Convert latitude and longitude to a locator


  This is a multipurpose command that allows you either to calculate the
  distance and bearing between two locators or (if only one locator is
  given on the command line) the distance and beraing from your station
  to the locator. For example:-



       SH/QRA IO92QL
       SH/QRA JN06 IN73




  The first example will show the distance and bearing to the locator
  from yourself, the second example will calculate the distance and
  bearing from the first locator to the second. You can use 4 or 6
  character locators.

  It is also possible to convert a latitude and longitude to a locator
  by using this command with a latitude and longitude as an argument,
  for example:-



       SH/QRA 52 41 N 0 58 E





  9.123.  show/qrz (0)

  show/qrz <callsign> Show any callbook details on a callsign


  This command queries the QRZ callbook server on the internet and
  returns any information available for that callsign. This service is
  provided for users of this software by http://www.qrz.com


  9.124.  show/route (0)

  show/route <callsign> Show the route to <callsign>


  This command allows you to see to which node the callsigns specified
  are connected. It is a sort of inverse sh/config.



    sh/route n2tly





  9.125.  show/satellite (0)

  show/satellite <name> [<hours> <interval>] Show satellite tracking
  data


  Show the tracking data from your location to the satellite of your
  choice from now on for the next few hours.

  If you use this command without a satellite name it will display a
  list of all the satellites known currently to the system.

  If you give a name then you can obtain tracking data of all the passes
  that start and finish 5 degrees below the horizon. As default it will
  give information for the next three hours for every five minute
  period.

  You can alter the number of hours and the step size, within certain
  limits.

  Each pass in a period is separated with a row of '-----' characters

  So for example:-



       SH/SAT AO-10
       SH/SAT FENGYUN1 12 2





  9.126.  show/sun (0)

  show/sun [<prefix>|<callsign>] Show sun rise and set times


  Show the sun rise and set times for a (list of) prefixes or callsigns,
  together with the azimuth and elevation of the sun currently at those
  locations.

  If you don't specify any prefixes or callsigns, it will show the times
  for your QTH (assuming you have set it with either SET/LOCATION or
  SET/QRA), together with the current azimuth and elevation.

  If all else fails it will show the sunrise and set times for the node
  that you are connected to.

  For example:-



         SH/SUN
         SH/SUN G1TLH K9CW ZS





  9.127.  show/time (0)

  show/time [<prefix>|<callsign>] Show the local time


  If no prefixes or callsigns are given then this command returns the

  set to respawn in /etc/inittab it will of course restart.


  9.131.  spoof (9)

  spoof <callsign> <command> Run commands as another user


  This is a very simple yet powerful command for the sysop.  It allows
  you to issue commands as if you were a different user.  This is very
  useful for the kind of things that users seem to always get wrong..
  like home_node for example.


  9.132.  stat/db (5)

  stat/db <dbname> Show the status of a database


  Show the internal status of a database descriptor.

  Depending on your privilege level you will see more or less
  information.  This command is unlikely to be of much use to anyone
  other than a sysop.




  9.133.  stat/channel (5)

  stat/channel <callsign> Show the status of a channel on the cluster


  Show the internal status of the channel object either for the channel
  that you are on or else for the callsign that you asked for.

  Only the fields that are defined (in perl term) will be displayed.


  9.134.  stat/msg (5)

  stat/msg <msgno> Show the status of a message


  This command shows the internal status of a message and includes
  information such as to whom it has been forwarded, its size, origin
  etc etc.


  9.135.  stat/user (5)

  stat/user <callsign> Show the full status of a user


  Shows the full contents of a user record including all the secret
  flags and stuff.

  Only the fields that are defined (in perl term) will be displayed.


  9.136.  sysop (0)

  sysop Regain your privileges if you login remotely


  The system automatically reduces your privilege level to that of a
  normal user if you login in remotely. This command allows you to
  regain your normal privilege level. It uses the normal system: five
  numbers are returned that are indexes into the character array that is
  your assigned password (see SET/PASSWORD). The indexes start from
  zero.

  You are expected to return a string which contains the characters
  required in the correct order. You may intersperse those characters
  with others to obscure your reply for any watchers. For example (and
  these values are for explanation :-):



         password = 012345678901234567890123456789
         > sysop
         22 10 15 17 3




  you type:-



        aa2bbbb0ccc5ddd7xxx3n
        or 2 0 5 7 3
        or 20573

  They will all match. If there is no password you will still be offered
  numbers but nothing will happen when you input a string. Any match is
  case sensitive.


  9.137.  talk (0)

  talk <callsign> Enter talk mode with <callsign>
  talk <callsign> <text> Send a text message to <callsign>
  talk <callsign> > <node_call> [<text>] Send a text message to
  <callsign> via <node_call>


  Send a short message to any other station that is visible on the
  cluster system. You can send it to anyone you can see with a
  SHOW/CONFIGURATION command, they don't have to be connected locally.

  The second form of TALK is used when other cluster nodes are connected
  with restricted information. This usually means that they don't send
  the user information usually associated with logging on and off the
  cluster.

  If you know that G3JNB is likely to be present on GB7TLH, but you can
  only see GB7TLH in the SH/C list but with no users, then you would use
  the second form of the talk message.

  If you want to have a ragchew with someone you can leave the text
  message out and the system will go into 'Talk' mode. What this means
  is that a short message is sent to the recipient telling them that you
  are in a 'Talking' frame of mind and then you just type - everything
  you send will go to the station that you asked for.

  All the usual announcements, spots and so on will still come out on
  your terminal.

  If you want to do something (such as send a spot) you precede the
  normal command with a '/' character, eg:-



          /DX 14001 G1TLH What's a B class licensee doing on 20m CW?
          /HELP talk




  To leave talk mode type:



          /EX





  9.138.  type (0)

  type <filearea>/<name> Look at a file in one of the fileareas


  Type out the contents of a file in a filearea. So, for example, in
  filearea 'bulletins' you want to look at file 'arld051' you would
  enter:-


          TYPE bulletins/arld051




  See also SHOW/FILES to see what fileareas are available and a list of
  content.


  9.139.  who (0)

  who Show who is physically connected locally


  This is a quick listing that shows which callsigns are connected and
  what sort of connection they have


  9.140.  wx (0)

  wx <text> Send a weather message to local users
  wx full <text>  Send a weather message to all cluster users


  Weather messages can sometimes be useful if you are experiencing an
  extreme that may indicate enhanced conditions


  9.141.  wx (enhanced for sysops) (5)

  wx sysop <text> Send a weather message to other clusters only


  Send a weather message only to other cluster nodes and not to general
  users.
