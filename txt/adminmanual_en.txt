  1.  Routing and Filtering

  1.1.  Introduction

  From DXSpider version 1.48, major changes were introduced to the way
  node connections are treated.  This is part of an ongoing process to
  remove problems with loops and to enable talk and other functions to
  propagate across the whole of the worldwide cluster network.  In fact,
  in a Spider network, it would be useful, perhaps even necessary to
  have loops.  This would give real resilience to the network, meaning
  that if a link dropped, the information flow would simply come in and
  go out via a different route.  Of course, we do not have a complete
  network of Spider nodes, there are other programs out there.  Some of
  these do not have any protection from loops.  Certainly AK1A does not
  handle loops well at all.  It is therefore necessary to have some form
  of protection for these nodes.


  In fact DXSpider has had a simple system for some time which is called
  isolation. This is similar to what in other systems such as clx, is
  called passive mode. A more detailed explanation of isolation is given
  further below. This system is still available and, for simple
  networks, is probably all that you need.


  The new functionality introduced in version 1.48 allows filtering the
  node and user protocol frames on a "per interface" basis. We call this
  route filtering. This is used instead of isolation.


  What this really means is that you can control more or less completely
  which user and node management PC protocol frames pass to each of your
  partner nodes. You can also limit what comes into your node from your
  partners. It is even possible to control the settings that your
  partner node has for the routing information that it sends to you
  (using the rcmd command).


  1.2.  Route Filters

  Initially when route filters were being tested we generated a
  "default" filter.  Unfortunately it quickly became apparent that this
  might suit the UK cluster network but didn't really fit anybody else.
  However using a default filter is an appropriate thing to do. How, is
  explained further on.


  The first thing that you must do is determine whether you need to use
  route filtering at all. If you are a "normal" node with two or three
  partners and you arranged in an "official" non-looping tree type
  network, then you do not need to do route filtering and you will feel
  a lot better for not getting involved. If you are successfully using
  isolation then you also probably don't need to use route filtering.


  To put it simply, you should not mix Isolation and Route Filtering.
  It will work, of sorts, but you will not get the expected results.  If
  you are using Isolation sucessfully at the moment, do not get involved
  in Route Filtering unless you have a good supply of aspirin!  Once you
  have started down the road of Route Filtering, do not use Isolation
  either.  Use one or the other, not both.


  You will only require this functionality if you are "well-connected".
  What that means is that you are connected to several different parts
  of (say) the EU cluster and, at the same time, also connected to two
  or three places in the US which, in turn are connected back to the EU.
  This is called a "loop" and if you are seriously looped then you need
  filtering.



  I should at this stage give a little bit of background on filters.
  All the filters in Spider work in basically the same way.  You can
  either accept or reject various options in order to create the filter
  rules you wish to achieve.  Some filters are user settable, others can
  only be altered by the sysop.  Route filtering can only be done by the
  sysop.



  Anyway, without further discouragement, let me start the process of
  explanation.


  1.3.  The node_default filter

  All normal systems should have a default routing filter and it should
  usually be set to send only the normal, unlooped, view of your
  "national" network.  Here in the UK that means nodes from the UK and
  Eire, in EU it is more complex as the networks there grew up in a more
  intertwined way.



  The generic commands are:-



       reject/route node_default <filter_option>

       or

       accept/route node_default <filter_option>



  where filter_option is one of the following ...



       call <prefixes>
       call_dxcc <numbers>
       call_itu <numbers>
       call_zone <numbers>
       channel <prefixes>
       channel_dxcc <numbers>
       channel_itu <numbers>
       channel_zone <numbers>



  Please be careful if you alter this setting, it will affect ALL your
  links!  Remember, this is a default filter for node connections, not a
  per link default.


  For the default routing filter then you have two real choices: either
  a "national" view or the "safe" option of only your own callsign.
  Examples of each (for my node: GB7DJK) are:-



       acc/route node_default call_dxcc 61,38
       acc/route node_default call gb7djk

  GB7DJK uses the first of these. The DXCC countries can be obtained
  from the show/prefix command.


  The example filters shown control output TO all your partner nodes
  unless they have a specific filter applied to them (see next section).


  It is also possible to control the incoming routing information that
  you are prepared to accept FROM your partner nodes. The reason this is
  necessary is to make sure that stuff like mail, pings and similar
  commands a) go down the correct links and b) don't loop around
  excessively. Again using GB7DJK as an example a typical default input
  filter would be something like:



       rej/route node_default input call_dxcc 61,38 and not channel_dxcc 61,38



  What this does is accept node and user information for our national
  network from nodes that are in our national network, but rejects such
  information from anyone else. Although it doesn't explicitly say so,
  by implication, any other node information (not from the UK and Eire)
  is accepted.


  As I imagine it will take a little while to get one's head around all
  of this you can study the effect of any rules that you try by watching
  the debug output after having done:-



       set/debug filter



  After you have got tired of that, to put it back the way it was:-



       unset/debug filter



  1.4.  General route filtering

  Exactly the same rules apply for general route filtering.  You would
  use either an accept filter or a reject filter like this ...



       reject/route <node_call> <filter_option>

       or

       accept/route <node_call> <filter_option>



  Here are some examples of route filters ...



       rej/route gb7djk call_dxcc 61,38 (send everything except UK+EIRE nodes)
       rej/route all                    (equiv to [very] restricted mode)
       acc/route gb7djk call_dxcc 61,38 (send only UK+EIRE nodes)
       acc/route gb7djk call gb7djk     (equiv to SET/ISOLATE)



  In practice you will either be opening the default filter out for a
  partner by defining a specific filter for that callsign:-



       acc/route gb7baa all
       acc/route gb7baa input all



  or restricting it quite a lot, in fact making it very nearly like an
  isolated node, like this:-



       acc/route pi4ehv-8 call gb7djk
       rej/route pi4ehv-8 input call_dxcc 61,38



  This last example takes everything except UK and Eire from PI4EHV-8
  but only sends him my local configuration (just a PC19 for GB7DJK and
  PC16s for my local users).


  It is possible to write much more complex rules, there are up to 10
  accept/reject pairs per callsign per filter. For more information see
  the next section.



  1.5.  General filter rules

  Upto v1.44 it was not possible for the user to set their own filters.
  From v1.45 though that has all changed.  It is now possible to set
  filters for just about anything you wish.  If you have just updated
  from an older version of DXSpider you will need to update your new
  filters.  You do not need to do anything with your old filters, they
  will be renamed as you update.


  There are 3 basic commands involved in setting and manipulating
  filters.  These are accept, reject and clear.  First we will look
  generally at filtering. There are a number of things you can filter in
  the DXSpider system. They all use the same general mechanism.


  In general terms you can create a "reject" or an "accept" filter which
  can have up to 10 lines in it. You do this using, for example ...



  accept/spots .....
  reject/spots .....



  where ..... are the specific commands for that type of filter. There
  are filters for spots, wwv, announce, wcy and (for sysops) connects.
  See each different accept or reject command reference for more
  details.

  There is also a command to clear out one or more lines in a filter.
  They are ...



       clear/spots 1
       clear/spots all



  There is clear/xxxx command for each type of filter.


  and you can check that your filters have worked by the command ...



       show/filter



  For now we are going to use spots for the examples, but you can apply
  the same principles to all types of filter.


  1.6.  Types of filter

  There are two main types of filter, accept or reject.  You can use
  either to achieve the result you want dependent on your own preference
  and which is more simple to do.  It is pointless writing 8 lines of
  reject filters when 1 accept filter would do the same thing!  Each
  filter has 10 lines (of any length) which are tried in order.  If a
  line matches then the action you have specified is taken (ie reject
  means ignore it and accept means take it)


  If you specify reject filters, then any lines that arrive that match
  the filter will be dumped but all else will be accepted.  If you use
  an accept filter, then ONLY the lines in the filter will be accepted
  and all else will be dumped.  For example if you have a single line
  accept filter ...



       accept/spots on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)



  then you will ONLY get VHF spots from or to CQ zones 14, 15 and 16.

  If you set a reject filter like this ...



       reject/spots on hf/cw



  Then you will get everything EXCEPT HF CW spots.  You could make this
  single filter even more flexible.  For example, if you are interested
  in IOTA and will work it even on CW even though normally you are not
  interested in CW, then you could say ...



       reject/spots on hf/cw and not info iota



  But in that case you might only be interested in iota and say:-



       accept/spots not on hf/cw or info iota



  which achieves exactly the same thing. You should choose one or the
  other until you are comfortable with the way it works. You can mix
  them if you wish (actually you can have an accept AND a reject on the
  same line) but don't attempt this until you are sure you know what you
  are doing!


  You can arrange your filter lines into logical units, either for your
  own understanding or simply convenience. Here is an example ...



       reject/spots 1 on hf/cw
       reject/spots 2 on 50000/1400000 not (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)



  What this does is to ignore all HF CW spots and also rejects any spots
  on VHF which don't either originate or spot someone in Europe.


  This is an example where you would use a line number (1 and 2 in this
  case), if you leave the digit out, the system assumes '1'. Digits
  '0'-'9' are available.  This make it easier to see just what filters
  you have set.  It also makes it more simple to remove individual
  filters, during a contest for example.


  You will notice in the above example that the second line has
  brackets.  Look at the line logically.  You can see there are 2
  separate sections to it.  We are saying reject spots that are VHF or
  above APART from those in zones 14, 15 and 16 (either spotted there or
  originated there).  If you did not have the brackets to separate the 2
  sections, then Spider would read it logically from the front and see a
  different expression entirely ...
       (on 50000/1400000 and by_zone 14,15,16) or call_zone 14,15,16



  The simple way to remember this is, if you use OR - use brackets.
  Whilst we are here CASE is not important. 'And BY_Zone' is just the
  same as 'and by_zone'.

  As mentioned earlier, setting several filters can be more flexible
  than simply setting one complex one.  Doing it in this way means that
  if you want to alter your filter you can just redefine or remove one
  or more lines of it or one line. For example ...



       reject/spots 1 on hf/ssb



  would redefine our earlier example, or



       clear/spots 1



  To remove all the filter lines in the spot filter ...



       clear/spots all



  1.7.  Filter options

  You can filter in several different ways.  The options are listed in
  the various helpfiles for accept, reject and filter.


  1.8.  Default filters

  Sometimes all that is needed is a general rule for node connects.
  This can be done with a node_default filter.  This rule will always be
  followed, even if the link is isolated, unless another filter is set
  specifically.  Default rules can be set for nodes and users.  They can
  be set for spots, announces, WWV and WCY.  They can also be used for
  hops.  An example might look like this ...



       accept/spot node_default by_zone 14,15,16,20,33
       set/hops node_default spot 50



  This filter is for spots only, you could set others for announce, WWV
  and WCY.  This filter would work for ALL nodes unless a specific
  filter is written to override it for a particular node.  You can also
  set a user_default should you require.  It is important to note that
  default filters should be considered to be "connected".  By this I
  mean that should you override the default filter for spots, you need
  to add a rule for the hops for spots also.


  1.9.  Advanced filtering

  Once you are happy with the results you get, you may like to
  experiment.


  The previous example that filters hf/cw spots and accepts vhf/uhf
  spots from EU can be written with a mixed filter, for example ...



       rej/spot on hf/cw
       acc/spot on 0/30000
       acc/spot 2 on 50000/1400000 and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)



  Note that the first filter has not been specified with a number.  This
  will automatically be assumed to be number 1.  In this case, we have
  said reject all HF spots in the CW section of the bands but accept all
  others at HF.  Also accept anything in VHF and above spotted in or by
  operators in the zones 14, 15 and 16.  Each filter slot actually has a
  'reject' slot and an 'accept' slot. The reject slot is executed BEFORE
  the accept slot.


  It was mentioned earlier that after a reject test that doesn't match,
  the default for following tests is 'accept', the reverse is true for
  'accept'. In the example what happens is that the reject is executed
  first, any non hf/cw spot is passed to the accept line, which lets
  through everything else on HF.  The next filter line lets through just
  VHF/UHF spots from EU.


  1.10.  Basic hop control

  In /spider/data you will find a file called hop_table.pl.  This is the
  file that controls your hop count settings.  It has a set of default
  hops on the various PC frames and also a set for each node you want to
  alter the hops for.  You may be happy with the default settings of
  course, but this powerful tool can help to protect and improve the
  network.  The file will look something like this ...



  #
  # hop table construction
  #

  package DXProt;

  # default hopcount to use
  $def_hopcount = 5;

  # some variable hop counts based on message type
  %hopcount =
  (
   11 => 10,
   16 => 10,
   17 => 10,
   19 => 10,
   21 => 10,
  );


  # the per node hop control thingy


  %nodehops =
  (
   GB7ADX => {            11 => 8,
                          12 => 8,
                          16 => 8,
                          17 => 8,
                          19 => 8,
                          21 => 8,
                     },

   GB7UDX => {            11 => 8,
                          12 => 8,
                          16 => 8,
                          17 => 8,
                          19 => 8,
                          21 => 8,
                     },
   GB7BAA => {
                          11 => 5,
                          12 => 8,
                          16 => 8,
                          17 => 8,
                          19 => 8,
                          21 => 8,
                     },
  );



  Each set of hops is contained within a pair of curly braces and
  contains a series of PC frame types.  PC11 for example is a DX spot.
  The figures here are not exhaustive but should give you a good idea of
  how the file works.


  SHould any of the nodecalls include an ssid, it is important to wrap
  the whole call in single quotes, like this ...



   'DB0FHF-15' => {
                          11 => 5,
                          12 => 8,
                          16 => 8,
                          17 => 8,
                          19 => 8,
                          21 => 8,
                     },



  If you do not do this, you will get errors and the file will not work
  as expected.


  You can alter this file at any time, including whilst the cluster is
  running.  If you alter the file during runtime, the command load/hops
  will bring your changes into effect.


  1.11.  Hop Control on Specific Nodes

  You can set a callsign specific hop count for any of the standard
  filter options so:-



       set/hops gb7djk spot 4
       set/hops node_default route 10
       set/hops gb7baa wcy 5



  all work on their specific area of the protocol.


  The set/hops command overrides any hops that you have set otherwise.


  You can show what hops have been set using the show/hops command.


  1.12.  Isolating networks

  It is possible to isolate networks from each other on a "gateway" node
  using the set/isolate <node_call> command.


  The effect of this is to partition an isolated network completely from
  another node connected to your node. Your node will appear on and
  otherwise behave normally on every network to which you are connected,
  but data from an isolated network will not cross onto any other
  network or vice versa. However all the spot, announce and WWV traffic
  and personal messages will still be handled locally (because you are a
  real node on all connected networks), that is locally connected users
  will appear on all networks and will be able to access and receive
  information from all networks transparently.  All routed messages will
  be sent as normal, so if a user on one network knows that you are a
  gateway for another network, he can still still send a talk/announce
  etc message via your node and it will be routed across.


  If you use isolate on a node connection you will continue to receive
  all information from the isolated partner, however you will not pass
  any information back to the isolated node.  There are times when you
  would like to forward only spots across a link (maybe during a contest
  for example).  To do this, isolate the node in the normal way and use
  an acc/spot >call< all filter to override the isolate.


  1.13.  A DXSpider Filtering Tutorial

  There is now an excellent primer/tutorial on filtering written by Jim
  Samuels, W3BG with an introduction by Dave Hawes N3RD that I strongly
  suggest you read.  You can read it here The DXSpider User Filtering
  Primer


  2.  Other filters

  2.1.  Filtering Mail

  In the /spider/msg directory you will find a file called
  badmsg.pl.issue.  Rename this to badmsg.pl and edit the file.  The
  original looks something like this ....



       # the list of regexes for messages that we won't store having
       # received them (bear in mind that we must receive them fully before
       # we can bin them)


       # The format of each line is as follows

       #     type      source             pattern
       #     P/B/F     T/F/O/S            regex

       # type: P - private, B - bulletin (msg), F - file (ak1a bull)
       # source: T - to field, F - from field,  O - origin, S - subject
       # pattern: a perl regex on the field requested

       # Currently only type B and P msgs are affected by this code.
       #
       # The list is read from the top down, the first pattern that matches
       # causes the action to be taken.

       # The pattern can be undef or 0 in which case it will always be selected
       # for the action specified



       package DXMsg;

       @badmsg = (
       );



  I think this is fairly self explanatory.  It is simply a list of
  subject headers that we do not want to pass on to either the users of
  the cluster or the other cluster nodes that we are linked to.  This is
  usually because of rules and regulations pertaining to items for sale
  etc in a particular country.



  2.2.  Filtering words from text fields in Announce, Talk and DX spots

  From version 1.48 onwards the interface to this has changed. You can
  now use the commands set/badword to add words that you are not
  prepared to see on the cluster, unset/badword to allow that word again
  and show/badword to list the words that you have set.


  If you have a previous /spider/data/badwords, the first time you start
  the node, it will read and convert this file to the new commands. The
  old style file will then be removed.


  2.3.  Stopping (possibly bad) DX Spots from Nodes or Spotters


  There are a number of commands that control whether a spot progresses
  any further by regarding it as "bad" in some way.


  A DX Spot has a number of fields which can be checked to see whether
  they contain "bad" values, they are: the DX callsign itself, the
  Spotter and the Originating Node.


  There are a set of commands which allow the sysop to control whether a
  spot continues:-



       set/baddx
       set/badspotter
       set/badnode



  These work in the same as the set/badword command, you can add any
  words or callsigns or whatever to the appropriate database. For
  example, to stop a spot from a particular node you do:



       set/badnode gb7djk gb7dxc



  a bad spotter:



       set/badspotter b0mb p1rat nocall



  and some bad dx:



       set/baddx video wsjt



  You can remove a word using the appropriate unset command
  (unset/baddx, unset/badspotter, unset/badnode) or list them using one
  of show/baddx, show/badspotter and show/badnode.


  3.  Mail

  DXSpider deals seamlessly with standard AK1A type mail.  It supports
  both personal and bulletin mail and the sysop has additional commands
  to ensure that mail gets to where it is meant.  DXSpider will send
  mail almost immediately, assuming that the target is on line.
  However, only one mail message is dealt with at any one time.  If a
  mail message is already being sent or recieved, then the new message
  will be queued until it has finished.

  The cluster mail is automatically deleted after 30 days unless the
  sysop sets the "keep" flag using the msg command.


  3.1.  Personal mail

  Personal mail is sent using the sp command.  This is actually the
  default method of sending mail and so a simple s for send will do.  A
  full list of the send commands and options is in the command set
  section, so I will not duplicate them here.


  3.2.  Bulletin mail

  Bulletin mail is sent by using the sb command.  This is one of the
  most common mistakes users make when sending mail.  They send a
  bulletin mail with s or sp instead of sb and of course the message
  never leaves the cluster.  This can be rectified by the sysop by using
  the msg command.


  Bulletin addresses can be set using the Forward.pl file.


  3.3.  Forward.pl

  DXSpider receives all and any mail sent to it without any alterations
  needed in files.  Because personal and bulletin mail are treated
  differently, there is no need for a list of accepted bulletin
  addresses.  It is necessary, however, to tell the program which links
  accept which bulletins.  For example, it is pointless sending
  bulletins addresses to "UK" to any links other than UK ones.  The file
  that does this is called forward.pl and lives in /spider/msg.  At
  default, like other spider files it is named forward.pl.issue.  Rename
  it to forward.pl and edit the file to match your requirements.  The
  format is below ...



  #
  # this is an example message forwarding file for the system
  #
  # The format of each line is as follows
  #
  #     type    to/from/at pattern action  destinations
  #     P/B/F     T/F/A     regex   I/F    [ call [, call ...] ]
  #
  # type: P - private, B - bulletin (msg), F - file (ak1a bull)
  # to/from/at: T - to field, F - from field, A - home bbs, O - origin
  # pattern: a perl regex on the field requested
  # action: I - ignore, F - forward
  # destinations: a reference to an array containing node callsigns
  #
  # if it is non-private and isn't in here then it won't get forwarded
  #
  # Currently only type B msgs are affected by this code.
  #
  # The list is read from the top down, the first pattern that matches
  # causes the action to be taken.
  #
  # The pattern can be undef or 0 in which case it will always be selected
  # for the action specified
  #
  # If the BBS list is undef or 0 and the action is 'F' (and it matches the
  # pattern) then it will always be forwarded to every node that doesn't have
  # it (I strongly recommend you don't use this unless you REALLY mean it, if
  # you allow a new link with this on EVERY bull will be forwarded immediately
  # on first connection)
  #

  package DXMsg;

  @forward = (
  );



  Simply insert a bulletin address and state in the brackets where you
  wish that mail to go.  For example, you can see here that mail sent to
  "UK" will only be sent to the UK links and not to PA4AB-14.


  To force the cluster to reread the file use load/forward


  NB: If a user tries to send mail to a bulletin address that does not
  exist in this file, they will get an error.


  3.4.  The msg command

  The msg command is a very powerful and flexible tool for the sysop.
  It allows the sysop to alter to and from fields and make other changes
  to manage the cluster mail.

  Here is a full list of the various options ...



    MSG TO <msgno> <call>     - change TO callsign to <call>
    MSG FRom <msgno> <call>   - change FROM callsign to <call>
    MSG PRrivate <msgno>      - set private flag
    MSG NOPRrivate <msgno>    - unset private flag
    MSG RR <msgno>            - set RR flag
    MSG NORR <msgno>          - unset RR flag
    MSG KEep <msgno>          - set the keep flag (message won't be deleted ever)
    MSG NOKEep <msgno>        - unset the keep flag
    MSG SUbject <msgno> <new> - change the subject to <new>
    MSG WAittime <msgno>      - remove any waiting time for this message
    MSG NOREad <msgno>        - mark message as unread
    MSG REad <msgno>          - mark message as read
    MSG QUeue                 - queue any outstanding bulletins
    MSG QUeue 1               - queue any outstanding private messages



  These commands are simply typed from within the cluster as the sysop
  user.


  3.5.  Message status

  You can check on a message from within the cluster by using the
  command stat/msg.  This will give you additional information on the
  message number including which nodes have received it, which node it
  was received from and when etc.  Here is an example of the output of
  the command ...



       G0VGS de GB7MBC 28-Jan-2001 1308Z >
       stat/msg 6869
               From: GB7DJK
           Msg Time: 26-Jan-2001 1302Z
              Msgno: 6869
             Origin: GB7DJK
               Size: 8012
            Subject: AMSAT 2line KEPS 01025.AMSAT
                 To: UK
       Got it Nodes: GB7BAA, GB7ADX
            Private: 0
       Read Confirm: 0
         Times read: 0
       G0VGS de GB7MBC 28-Jan-2001 1308Z >



  3.6.  Filtering mail

  This is described in the section on Other filters so I will not
  duplicate it here.


  3.7.  Distribution lists

  Distribution lists are simply a list of users to send certain types of
  mail to.  An example of this is mail you only wish to send to other
  sysops.  In /spider/msg there is a directory called distro.  You put
  any distibution lists in here.  For example, here is a file called
  SYSOP.pl that caters for the UK sysops.


       qw(GB7TLH GB7DJK GB7DXM GB7CDX GB7BPQ GB7DXN GB7MBC GB7MBC-6 GB7MDX
          GB7NDX GB7SDX GB7TDX GB7UDX GB7YDX GB7ADX GB7BAA GB7DXA GB7DXH
          GB7DXK GB7DXI GB7DXS)



  Any mail sent to "sysop" would only be sent to the callsigns in this
  list.


  3.8.  BBS interface

  Spider provides a simple BBS interface.  No input is required from the
  sysop of the cluster at all.  The BBS simply sets the cluster as a BBS
  and pushes any required mail to the cluster.  No mail can flow from
  Spider to the BBS, the interface is one-way.


  Please be careful not to flood the cluster network with unnecessary
  mail.  Make sure you only send mail to the clusters that want it by
  using the Forward.pl file very carefully.


  4.  Scripts

  From 1.48 onwards it will become increasingly possible to control
  DXSpider's operation with scripts of various kinds.


  The directory /spider/scripts is where it all happens and is used for
  several things.  Firstly it contains a file called startup that can be
  used to call in any changes to the cluster from the default settings
  on startup.  This script is executed immediately after all
  initialisation of the node is done but before any connections are
  possible.  Examples of this include how many spots it is possible to
  get with the sh/dx command, whether you want registration/passwords to
  be permanently on etc.  An example file is shown below and is included
  in the distribution as startup.issue.



       #
       # startup script example
       #
       # set maximum no of spots allowed to 100
       # set/var $Spot::maxspots = 100
       #
       # Set registration on
       # set/var $main::reqreg = 1
       #
       # Set passwords on
       # set/var $main::passwdreq = 1
       #



  As usual, any text behind a # is treated as a comment and not read.
  To use this file, simply rename it from startup.issue to startup.  In
  our example above there are three options.  The first option is the
  amount of spots that a user can request with the sh/dx command.
  Normally the default is to give 10 spots unless the user specifies
  more.  Without this line enabled, the maximum a user can request is
  100 spots.  Depending on your link quality you may wish to enable more
  or less by specifying the number.


  The other 2 options are dealt with more fully in the security section.


  Secondly, it is used to store the login scripts for users and nodes.
  Currently this can only be done by the sysop but it is envisaged that
  eventually users will be able to set their own.  An example is
  included in the distibution but here is a further example.



       #
       # G0FYD
       #
       blank +
       sh/wwv 3
       blank +
       sh/dx
       blank +
       t g0jhc You abt?
       blank +



  The lines in between commands can simply insert a blank line or a
  character such as a + sign to make the output easier to read.  Simply
  create this script with your favourite editor and save it with the
  callsign of the user as the filename.  Filenames should always be in
  lower case.


  Commands can be inserted in the same way for nodes.  A node may wish a
  series of commands to be issued on login, such as a merge command for
  example.


  Thirdly, there are 2 default scripts for users and nodes who do not
  have a specifically defined script.  These are user_default and
  node_default


  5.  Databases

  Spider allows the creation of local or remote databases.  It supports
  chained databases, allowing several different databases to be scanned
  with one simple command.  Importing of databases is limited at present
  to the standard AK1A databases such as OBLAST and the DB0SDX QSL
  database but will expand with time.


  5.1.  Creating databases

  Creating a database could not be more simple.  All the commands are
  sent from the cluster prompt as the sysop user.

  To create a database you use the command dbcreate.  It can be used in
  3 different ways like so ..



       dbcreate <name>


  To simply create a database locally, you just tell the command the
  name of the database.  This does not create the actual database, it
  simply defines it to say that it exists.



       dbcreate <name> chain <name> [<name>...]



  This creates a chained database entry.  The first database will be
  scanned, then the second, the third etc...



       dbcreate <name> remote <name>



  This creates a remote entry.  the first name field is the database
  name at the remote node, then the remote switch, then the actual
  node_call of the remote node, for example...



       dbcreate buckmaster remote gb7dxc



  Remote databases cannot be chained, however, the last database in a
  chain can be a remote database.


  5.2.  Importing databases

  The only databases that Spider can currently import are the standard
  AK1A databases such as OBLAST or the DB0SDX qsl and address database.
  This will be added to with time.

  To import such a database, first put the file somewhere useful like
  /tmp and then issue the following command ...



       dbimport oblast /tmp/OBLAST.FUL



  This will update the existing local oblast database or create it if it
  does not exist.


  5.3.  Checking available databases

  Once a database is created, you will want to check that it has been
  added.  To do this use the dbavail command.  This will output the
  available databases.  For example ...



  dbavail
  DB Name          Location   Chain
  qsl              Local
  buck             GB7ADX
  hftest           GB7DXM
  G0VGS de GB7MBC  3-Feb-2001 1925Z >



  5.4.  Looking up databases

  To look for information in a defined database, simply use the dbshow
  command, for example ...



       dbshow buckmaster G0YLM



  will show the information for the callsign G0YLM from the buckmaster
  database if it exists.  To make things more standard for the users you
  can add an entry in the Aliases file so that it looks like a standard
  show command like this ...



  Now you can simply use show/buckmaster or an abreviation.


  5.5.  Removing databases

  To delete an existing database you use the dbremove command.  For
  example ...



       dbremove oblast



  would remove the oblast database and its associated datafile from the
  system.  There are no warnings or recovery possible from this command.
  If you remove a database it ceases to exist and would have to be
  created from scratch if you still required it.


  6.  Information, files and useful programs

  6.1.  MOTD

  One of the more important things a cluster sysop needs to do is to get
  information to his users.  The simplest way to do this is to have a
  banner that is sent to the user on login.  This is know as a "message
  of the day" or "motd".  To set this up, simply create a file in
  /spider/data called motd and edit it to say whatever you want.  It is
  purely a text file and will be sent automatically to anyone logging in
  to the cluster.
  6.2.  MOTD_NOR

  This message of the day file lives in the same directory as the
  standard motd file but is only sent to non-registered users.  Once
  registered they will receive the same message as any other user.


  6.3.  Downtime message

  If for any reason the cluster is down, maybe for upgrade or
  maintenance but the machine is still running, a message can be sent to
  the user advising them of the fact.  This message lives in the
  /spider/data directory and is called "offline".  Simply create the
  file and edit it to say whatever you wish.  This file will be sent to
  a user attempting to log into the cluster when DXSpider is not
  actually running.


  6.4.  Other text messages

  You can set other text messages to be read by the user if they input
  the file name.  This could be for news items or maybe information for
  new users.  To set this up, make a directory under /spider called
  packclus.  Under this directory you can create files called news or
  newuser for example.  In fact you can create files with any names you
  like.  These can be listed by the user with the command ....



       show/files



  They can be read by the user by typing the command ....



       type news



  If the file they want to read is called news.  You could also set an
  alias for this in the Alias file to allow them just to type news


  You can also store other information in this directory, either
  directly or nested under directories.  One use for this would be to
  store DX bulletins such as the OPDX bulletins.  These can be listed
  and read by the user.  To keep things tidy, make a directory under
  /spider/packclus called bulletin.  Now copy any OPDX or similar
  bulletins into it.  These can be listed by the user in the same way as
  above using the show/files command with an extension for the bulletin
  directory you have just created, like this ....



       show/files bulletin



  An example would look like this ....

       sh/files
       bulletin      DIR 20-Dec-1999 1715Z news          1602 14-Dec-1999 1330Z



  You can see that in the files area (basically the packclus directory)
  there is a file called news and a directory called bulletin.  You can
  also see that dates they were created.  In the case of the file news,
  you can also see the time it was last modified, a good clue as to
  whether the file has been updated since you last read it.  To read the
  file called news you would simply issue the command ....



       type news



  To look what is in the bulletin directory you issue the command ....



       show/files bulletin
       opdx390      21381 29-Nov-1999 1621Z opdx390.1     1670 29-Nov-1999 1621Z

       opdx396.1     5537 29-Nov-1999 1621Z opdx396.2     6242 29-Nov-1999 1621Z
       opdx397      18433 29-Nov-1999 1621Z opdx398      19961 29-Nov-1999 1621Z

       Press Enter to continue, A to abort (16 lines) >



  You can now read any file in this directory using the type command,
  like this ....



       type bulletin/opdx391
       Ohio/Penn DX Bulletin No. 391
       The Ohio/Penn Dx PacketCluster
       DX Bulletin No. 391

  The page length will of course depend on what you have it set to!


  6.5.  The Aliases file

  You will find a file in /spider/cmd/ called Aliases.  This is the file
  that controls what a user gets when issuing a command.  It is also
  possible to create your own aliases for databases and files you create
  locally.


  You should not alter the original file in /spider/cmd/ but create a
  new file with the same name in /spider/local_cmd.  This means that any
  new Aliases files that is downloaded will not overwrite your self
  created Aliases and also that you do not override any new Aliases with
  your copy in /spider/local_cmd/.  You must remember that any files you
  store in /spider/local/ or /spider/local_cmd override the originals if
  the same lines are used in both files.


  The best way of dealing with all this then is to only put your own
  locally created Aliases in the copy in /spider/local_cmd.  The example
  below is currently in use at GB7MBC.



       #
       # Local Aliases File
       #

       package CmdAlias;

       %alias = (
           'n' => [
             '^news$', 'type news', 'type',
           ],
           's' => [
             '^sh\w*/buck$', 'show/qrz', 'show',
             '^sh\w*/hftest$', 'dbshow hftest', 'dbshow',
             '^sh\w*/qsl$', 'dbshow qsl', 'dbshow',
             '^sh\w*/vhf$', 'dbshow vhf', 'dbshow',
             '^sh\w*/vhftest$', 'dbshow vhftest', 'dbshow',
               ],
       )



  Each alphabetical section should be preceded by the initial letter and
  the section should be wrapped in square brackets as you can see.  The
  syntax is straightforward.  The first section on each line is the new
  command that will be allowed once the alias is included.  The second
  section is the command it is replacing and the last section is the
  actual command that is being used.


  The eagle-eyed amongst you will have noticed that in the first
  section, the new alias command has a '^' at the start and a '$' at the
  end.  Basically these force a perfect match on the alias.  The '^'
  says match the beginning exactly and the with similar commands.


  I have 3 different types of alias in this file.  At the top is an
  alias for 'news'.  This is a file I have created in the
  /spider/packclus/ directory where I can inform users of new
  developments or points of interest.  In it's initial form a user would
  have to use the command type news.  The alias allows them to simply
  type news to get the info.  Second is an alias for the show/qrz
  command so that those users used to the original show/buck command in
  AK1A will not get an error, and the rest of the lines are for locally
  created databases so that a user can type show/hftest instead of
  having to use the command dbshow hftest which is not as intuitive.


  This file is just an example and you should edit it to your own
  requirements.  Once created, simply issue the command load/alias at
  the cluster prompt as the sysop user and the aliases should be
  available.



  6.6.  Console.pl

  In later versions of Spider a simple console program is provided for
  the sysop.  This has a type ahead buffer with line editing facilities
  and colour for spots, announces etc.  To use this program, simply use
  console.pl instead of client.


  To edit the colours, copy /spider/perl/Console.pl to /spider/local and
  edit the file with your favourite editor.


  6.7.  Updating kepler data

  Spider has a powerful and flexible show/satellite command.  In order
  for this to be accurate, the kepler data has to be updated regularly.
  In general, this data is available as an email or via cluster mail.
  Updating it is simple.  First you need to export the mail message as a
  file.  You do this with the export command from the cluster prompt as
  the sysop.  For example ...



       export 5467 /spider/perl/keps.in



  would export message number 5467 as a file called keps.in in the
  /spider/perl directory.


  Now login to a VT as sysop and cd /spider/perl.  There is a command in
  the perl directory called convkeps.pl.  All we need to do now is
  convert the file like so ...



       ./convkeps.pl keps.in



  Now go back to the cluster and issue the command ...



  load/keps



  That is it!  the kepler data has been updated.


  6.8.  The QRZ callbook

  The command sh/qrz will only work once you have followed a few simple
  steps.  First you need to get a user ID and password from qrz.com.
  Simply go to the site and create one.  Secondly you need to copy the
  file /spider/perl/Internet.pm to /spider/local and alter it to match
  your user ID and password.  You also at this point need to set
  $allow=1 to complete the setup.  Many thanks to Fred Lloyd, the
  proprieter of qrz.com for allowing this access.


  6.9.  Connecting logging programs

  There appear to be very few logging programs out there that support
  telnet especially the popular ones like LogEQF, Turbolog etc.  This
  can make it difficult to connect to your own cluster!  The way to do
  it is to make the logging program think it has a TNC attached to a com
  port on the logging PC and 'push' a linux login out to it.  This is
  achieved very simply by the use of agetty.


  All that is required is to add a line in /etc/inittab to have the
  client ready for a connection on the com port of your choice.
  Remember that in Linux, the com ports start at ttyS0 for com1, ttyS1
  for com2 etc.



       c4:2345:respawn:/sbin/agetty -L 9600 ttyS1



  Add this after the standard runlevel lines in /etc/inittab.  The above
  line works on ttyS1 (com2).  Now as root, issue the command telinit q
  and it should be ready for connection.  All that is required is a 3
  wire serial lead (tx, rx and signal ground).  Tell you logging program
  to use 8n1 at 9600 baud and you should see a Linux login prompt.
  Login as normal and then telnet from there to the cluster.


  7.  Java Web applet

  In the spider tree will be a directory spider-web.  This is a neat
  little java web applet that can be run from a website.  The applet
  must run on the same machine as the cluster.  The included README file
  is shown below.


  I should comment here that the applet is precompiled, that is, ready
  to go.  It was compiled using JDK1.3.1.  If your version is earlier
  than this then it may not work.  Should that be the case you need to
  recompile or update your JDK.  To recompile do the following ...



  cd /spider/spider-web
  rm *.class
  /usr/bin/javac spiderclient.java



  I have used /usr/bin/javac as an example, your path to javac may be
  different.


  Spider-WEB v0.6b

  Completely based on a clx web client written in Java by dl6dbh
  (ftp://clx.muc.de/pub/clx/clx-java_10130001.tgz)

  The webserver has to run on the same machine as your DxSpider software!

  It is assumed that you have Java installed.  You need JDK1.3.1 at least.

  Installation instructions (Performed as root):

  Put all the files in the spider-web directory into a newly created directory
  under the DocumentRoot of your websever for instance 'client'. In my case
  this is:  /home/httpd/html/client/ although ymmv.  For Suse the correct
  path should be /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/client/ for example.

  Move spider.cgi to the cgi-bin directory of your webserver, in my case that is
  /home/httpd/cgi-bin/ although ymmv.  For Suse the correct path should be
  /usr/local/httpd/cgi-bin/ for example.

  Change the permissions of the files to ensure they are correct, obviously you
  will need to use the correct path the the files according to your system:

  chmod 755 /home/httpd/html/cgi-bin/spider.cgi
  chmod -R 755 /home/httpd/html/client/

  By default the spider.cgi script should pick up your hostname (As long as this
  is set correctly).  If it does not or your hostname differs from the name that
  you attach to the public address that you are using, then edit spider.cgi :

  # Uncomment and set the hostname manually here if the above fails.
  # $HOSTNAME = "gb7mbc.spoo.org" ;
  $PORT = "8000" ;


  telnet (see Listeners.pm)

  NOTE: If you can start the console but cannot connect to the cluster from it,
  then it is possible that the machine you are on cannot resolve the hostname of
  your cluster machine.  If this is the case, you need to set your hostname
  manually as above.

  You also need to set the $NODECALL variable.  This prints the name of your
  choosing (probably your cluster callsign) on the html page.

  You now can connect to Spider-Web via http://yourserver/cgi-bin/spider.cgi



  8.  Web based statistics

  From version 1.50, you can use the freeware software MRTG to produce
  really nice graphical statistics on your web site.  For an example try
  http://www.gb7mbc.net/mrtg/stats.html.


  The following should help you get it all working.


  First you need to download the latest version of MRTG from
  http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/mrtg/.  You will also need
  the following files..



       libpng-1.0.14.tar.gz
       zlib-1.1.4.tar.gz
       gd-1.8.3.tar.gz



  Login to your machine as the root user, put all the downloaded files
  in /usr/local/src/ (or wherever you prefer) and untar and compile
  them.  All the information to compile and install these sources come
  with them.  After compilation and installation,  you will find MRTG in
  /usr/local/mrtg-2.


  Now copy all the files in /usr/local/src/mrtg-2.9.22/images/ to
  /spider/html/mrtg/


  You now need to make 2 symbolic links like below...



       ln -s /usr/local/mrtg-2/bin/mrtg /usr/bin/mrtg
       ln -s /usr/local/mrtg-2/lib/mrtg2 /usr/lib/mrtg2



  Now login to the cluster with your sysop callsign and run the command
  "mrtg all".


  Now you are nearly there!  Login as the sysop user and change to the
  /spider/html/mrtg/ directory.  Now run the command indexmaker as shown
  below...



       indexmaker --output stats.html --columns=1 --title "MRTG statistics for GB7DJK" ../../mrtg/mrtg.cfg



  Changing the callsign for your own cluster callsign of course!


  And finally you need to login as the root user and create one last
  symbolic link.  Where this points will depend on where your html
  documents are kept.  For RedHat systems you use...



  ln -s /home/sysop/spider/html/mrtg /home/httpd/html/mrtg



  and for SuSE systems...



       ln -s /home/sysop/spider/html/mrtg /usr/local/httpd/htdocs/mrtg



  If you now point your browser to your website as below it should all
  be happening!



       http://www.xxx.xxx/mrtg/stats.html



  Of course, to get the stats to update, you need to add some
  information in the spider crontab file as below...



       # Update stats for mrtg on website
       00,05,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * run_cmd('mrtg all')



  This will update the site every 5 minutes.


  9.  Security

  From version 1.49 DXSpider has some additional security features.
  These are not by any means meant to be exhaustive, however they do
  afford some security against piracy.  These two new features can be
  used independently of each other or in concert to tighten the
  security.


  9.1.  Registration

  The basic principle of registration is simple.  If a user is not
  registered by the sysop, then they have read-only access to the
  cluster.  The only thing they can actually send is a talk or a message
  to the sysop.  In order for them to be able to spot, send announces or
  talks etc the sysop must register them with the set/register command,
  like this ...



       set/register g0vgs



  The user g0vgs can now fully use the cluster.  In order to enable
  registration, you can issue the command ...

       set/var $main::reqreg = 1



  Any users that are not registered will now see the motd_nor file
  rather than the motd file as discussed in the Information, files and
  useful programs section.


  Entering this line at the prompt will only last for the time the
  cluster is running of course and would not be present on a restart.
  To make the change permanent, add the above line to
  /spider/scripts/startup.  To read more on the startup file, see the
  section on Information, files and useful programs.


  To unregister a user use unset/register and to show the list of
  registered users, use the command show/register.


  9.2.  Passwords

  At the moment, passwords only affect users who login to a DXSpider
  cluster node via telnet.  If a user requires a password, they can
  either set it themselves or have the sysop enter it for them by using
  the set/password command.  Any users who already have passwords, such
  as remote sysops, will be asked for their passwords automatically by
  the cluster.  Using passwords in this way means that the user has a
  choice on whether to have a password or not.  To force the use of
  passwords at login, issue the command ...



       set/var $main::passwdreq = 1



  at the cluster prompt.  This can also be added to the
  /spider/scripts/startup file as above to make the change permanent.


  Of course, if you do this you will have to assign a password for each
  of your users.  If you were asking them to register, it is anticipated
  that you would ask them to send you a message both to ask to be
  registered and to give you the password they wish to use.


  Should a user forget their password, it can be reset by the sysop by
  first removing the existing password and then setting a new one like
  so ...



       unset/password g0vgs
       set/password g0vgs new_password



  10.  CVS



  10.1.  CVS from a Linux platform

  CVS stands for "Concurrent Versions System" and the CVS for DXSpider
  is held at Sourceforge.  This means that it is possible to update your
  DXSpider installation to the latest sources by using a few simple
  commands.  A graphical interface to CVS for Windows is explained in
  the next section.


  Please be aware that if you update your system using CVS, it is
  possible that you could be running code that is very beta and not
  fully tested.  There is a possibility that it could be unstable.


  I am of course assuming that you have a machine with both DXSpider and
  Internet access running.


  BEFORE YOU EVEN CONSIDER STARTING WITH THIS MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR
  ENTIRE SPIDER TREE!!


  Assuming you are connected to the Internet, you need to login to the
  CVS repository and then update your Spider source.  There are several
  steps which are listed below ...


  First login as the user sysop.  Next you need to connect to the CVS
  repository.  You do this with the command below ...


  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.DXSpider.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dxspider login



  You will get a password prompt.  Simply hit return here and your
  machine should return to a normal linux prompt.


  What happens next depends on whether you have an existing installation
  that you want to update with the latest and greatest or whether you
  just want to see what is there and/or run it on a new machine for
  testing.

  If you are installing Spider from CVS then change directory to
  /home/sysop

  If you are wanting to update Spider then cd to /tmp


  The next step will create a brand new 'spider' directory in your
  current directory.


  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.DXSpider.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dxspider co spider



  This command is all on one line.


  Hopefully your screen should show you downloading files.  The -z3
  simply compresses the download to improve speed.  When this has
  finished, you will have exactly the same as if you had untarred a full
  tarball PLUS some extra directories and files that CVS needs to do the
  magic that it does.
  Now if you are doing a new installation, that's it.  Carry on as if
  you have just downloaded and untarred the lastest tarball.


  If you want to upgrade your current installation then do this ...



       tar cvfz /tmp/s.tgz spider
       cd /
       tar xvfzp /tmp/s.tgz



  This is assuming you downloaded to the /tmp directory of course.


  NOTE:  the 'p' on the end of the 'xvfz' is IMPORTANT!   It keeps the
  permissions correct.  YOU WERE LOGGED IN AS THE USER SYSOP WEREN'T
  YOU?????

  Remember to recompile the C client (cd /spider/src; make)


  At this point the files have been upgraded.  You can (usually) restart
  the cluster in your own time.  However, if you attempt to use any new
  commands or features expect it to be fatal!  At least your cluster
  will have been restarted then so it will be too late to worry about
  it!


  Now the magic part!  From now on when you want to update, simply
  connect to the Internet and then, as the user sysop ...



       cd /spider
       cvs -z3 update -d



  and your files will be updated.  As above, remember to recompile the
  "C" client if it has been updated (CVS will tell you) and restart if
  any of the perl scripts have been altered or added, again, CVS will
  tell you.


  You will find any changes documented in the /spider/Changes file.


  10.2.  CVS from a Windows platform

  After the initial setup, an update to your DXSpider software is no
  more than a couple of clicks away.  This section is intended to
  explain and illustrate the use of the WinCVS application to update
  your DXSpider software.  The current stable version of WinCVS is Ver.
  1.2.  You can get this software at:

  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cvsgui/WinCvs120.zip

  Pick your download mirror and then install WinCVS after the download
  is complete.


  In this next section I have included a series of links to .jpg files
  to take advantage of the picture and 1000 words equivalency.  The .jpg
  files are in the C:\spider\html directory.  If someone using a Linux
  system is reading this section from boredom, the files are in
  /home/sysop/spider/html.  One aside, a Linux user can also get a copy
  of gcvs and do your updates graphically as opposed to from the command
  line.  The following descriptions are almost identical between WinCvs
  and gcvs.  The following screen shots have duplicate links, depending
  upon whether you are viewing this information under the Windows or
  Linux operating system.

  When WinCVS is installed, running, and you are connected to the
  internet, the initial screen looks like:

  initial.jpg

  If you want, you can also look at these .jpg files with another viewer
  that might provide some better clarity to the image.  On the left is
  the directory tree for your hard disk.  Notice that the spider
  directory has a gray highlight.

  To start configuring WinCVS, click on Admin at the top of the screen
  and then Preferences.  This should get you:

  pref-gen.jpg

  In the top line for CVSROOT, enter:


       anonymous@cvs.DXSpider.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/dxspider login



  and select


       "passwd" file on the cvs server



  for Authentication on the General tab.

  Next, move to the right to the Ports tab.

  pref-ports.jpg

  In here, check the box on the second line down for the "pserver" port.
  Enter a port number of 2401.

  Finally, go to the WinCvs tab all the way to the right.

  pref-wincvs.jpg

  Enter Notepad as the viewer to open files.  For the HOME folder, put
  "C:\spider" and click OK because the configuration is now complete.

  You are now ready to upgrade your copy of DXSpider.  Click on the
  greyed Spider folder shown in the directory tree on the left of the
  WinCVS display.  Two things should happen.  The Spider folder will be
  selected and the greyed-out arrow located just below the word Query in
  the top line will turn to solid green.

  For anyone using gcvs under Linux, the green arrow is located on the
  extreme left of the display, under the word File.  A gcvs screen looks
  like:

  gcvs.jpg

  Click on the now green arrow to start the download process.  An Update
  Settings box will be displayed to which you can simply say OK.

  update-OK.jpg

  For future reference, the Update Settings box is the place where you
  can enter information to revert to a prior version of DXSpider.
  Information on reverting to a Before Date is contained in the WinCVS
  manual.

  After a short period of time, a series of file names will scroll by in
  the lower pane of the WinCVS window.  Eventually you should see


       *****CVS exited normally with code 0*****



  appear in the lower pane.  You're done.  The updated files are in
  place ready for you to stop and then restart your DXSpider.  After the
  restart, you're running with the latest version of DXSpider.

  completed.jpg

  To paraphrase from the CVS section... Now the magic part!  From now on
  when you want to update, simply connect to the Internet and start
  WinCVS.


       Click on the greyed-out Spider directory in the left screen
       Click on the green down arrow
       Click OK on the Update Settings dialog box
       Restart your Spider software



  11.  The DXSpider Command Reference

  11.1.  accept (0)

  accept Set a filter to accept something

  Create a filter to accept somethingThere are 2 types of filter, accept
  and reject.  See HELP FILTERING for moreinfo.

  11.2.  accept/announce <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> (8)

  accept/announce <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> Announce filter sysop
  version

  This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as
  thedefault for nodes and users eg:-


         accept/ann by G,M,2  accept/ann input node_default by G,M,2  accept/ann user_default by G,M,2



  11.3.  accept/announce [0-9] <pattern> (0)

  accept/announce [0-9] <pattern> Set an 'accept' filter line for
  announce

  Create an 'accept this announce' line for a filter. An accept filter
  line means that if the announce matches this filter it ispassed onto
  the user. See HELP FILTERING for more info. Please read thisto
  understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief later on.You
  can use any of the following things in this line:-


         info <string>            eg: iota or qsl  by <prefixes>            eg: G,M,2           origin <prefixes>  origin_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)  origin_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW  origin_zone <prefixes or numbers>  origin_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,NH  by_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>  by_itu <prefixes or numbers>  by_zone <prefixes or numbers>  by_state <states>  channel <prefixes>  wx 1                     filter WX announces  dest <prefixes>          eg: 6MUK,WDX      (distros)



  some examples:-


         acc/ann dest 6MUK  acc/ann 2 by_zone 14,15,16  (this could be all on one line: acc/ann dest 6MUK or by_zone 14,15,16)



  or


         acc/ann by G,M,2



  for american states


         acc/ann by_state va,nh,ri,nh



  You can use the tag 'all' to accept everything eg:


         acc/ann all



  but this probably for advanced users...

  11.4.  accept/route <call> [0-9] <pattern> (8)

  accept/route <call> [0-9] <pattern> Set an 'accept' filter line for
  routing

  Create an 'accept this routing PC Protocol' line for a filter. An
  accept filter line means that if a PC16/17/19/21/24/41/50 matches this
  filter it is passed thru that interface. See HELP FILTERING for more
  info. Please read thisto understand how filters work - it will save a
  lot of grief later on.You can use any of the following things in this
  line:-


         call <prefixes>        the callsign of the thingy  call_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)  call_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW  call_zone <prefixes or numbers>  call_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,NH  origin <prefixes>      really the interface it came in on  origin_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)  origin_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW  origin_zone <prefixes or numbers>  origin_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,NH



  some examples:-


    acc/route gb7djk call_dxcc 61,38 (send only UK+EIRE nodes)  acc/route gb7djk call gb7djk     (equiv to SET/ISOLATE)



  you can now use 'by' as a synonym for 'call' so:


         by = call  by_dxcc = call_dxcc



  and so onYou can use the tag 'all' to accept everything eg:


         acc/route all



  11.5.  accept/spots <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> (8)

  accept/spots <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> Spot filter sysop version

         accept/spot user_default by G,M,2



  11.6.  accept/spots [0-9] <pattern> (0)

  accept/spots [0-9] <pattern> Set an 'accept' filter line for spots

  Create an 'accept this spot' line for a filter. An accept filter line
  means that if the spot matches this filter it ispassed onto the user.
  See HELP FILTERING for more info. Please read thisto understand how
  filters work - it will save a lot of grief later on.You can use any of
  the following things in this line:-


         freq <range>           eg: 0/30000 or hf or hf/cw or 6m,4m,2m  on <range>             same as 'freq'  call <prefixes>        eg: G,PA,HB9  info <string>          eg: iota or qsl  by <prefixes>              call_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)  call_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW  call_zone <prefixes or numbers>  call_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,ME  by_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>  by_itu <prefixes or numbers>  by_zone <prefixes or numbers>  by_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,ME  origin <prefixes>  channel <prefixes>



         acc/spot 1 on hf/cw  acc/spot 2 on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)



  You can use the tag 'all' to accept everything, eg:


         acc/spot 3 all



  for US states


         acc/spots by_state VA,NH,RI,MA,ME



  but this probably for advanced users...

  11.7.  accept/wcy <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> (8)

  accept/wcy <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> WCY filter sysop version

  This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as

  11.8.  accept/wcy [0-9] <pattern> (0)

  accept/wcy [0-9] <pattern> set an 'accept' WCY filter

  It is unlikely that you will want to do this, but if you do then you
  canfilter on the following fields:-


         by <prefixes>            eg: G,M,2           origin <prefixes>  origin_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)  origin_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW  origin_zone <prefixes or numbers>  by_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>  by_itu <prefixes or numbers>  by_zone <prefixes or numbers>  channel <prefixes>



  There are no examples because WCY Broadcasts only come from one place
  andyou either want them or not (see UNSET/WCY if you don't want
  them).This command is really provided for future use.See HELP FILTER
  for information.

  11.9.  accept/wwv <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> (8)

  accept/wwv <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> WWV filter sysop version

  This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as
  thedefault for nodes and users eg:-


         accept/wwv db0sue-7 1 by_zone 4  accept/wwv node_default all  set/hops node_default 10



         accept/wwv user_default by W,K



  11.10.  accept/wwv [0-9] <pattern> (0)

  accept/wwv [0-9] <pattern> set an 'accept' WWV filter

  It is unlikely that you will want to do this, but if you do then you
  canfilter on the following fields:-


    by <prefixes>            eg: G,M,2           origin <prefixes>  origin_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)  origin_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW  origin_zone <prefixes or numbers>  by_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>  by_itu <prefixes or numbers>  by_zone <prefixes or numbers>  channel <prefixes>



  for example


         accept/wwv by_zone 4



  is probably the only useful thing to do (which will only show WWV
  broadcastsby stations in the US).See HELP FILTER for information.

  11.11.  announce <text> (0)

  announce <text> Send an announcement to LOCAL users only

  <text> is the text of the announcement you wish to broadcast

  11.12.  announce full <text> (0)

  announce full <text> Send an announcement cluster wide

  This will send your announcement cluster wide

  11.13.  announce sysop <text> (5)

  announce sysop <text> Send an announcement to Sysops only


  11.14.  apropos <string> (0)

  apropos <string> Search help database for <string>

  Search the help database for <string> (it isn't case sensitive), and
  printthe names of all the commands that may be relevant.

  11.15.  blank [<string>] [<nn>] (0)

  blank [<string>] [<nn>] Print nn (default 1) blank lines (or strings)

  In its basic form this command prints one or more blank lines. However
  ifyou pass it a string it will replicate the string for the width of
  the screen (default 80) and then print that one or more times, so:


         blank 2



  prints two blank lines


         blank -



  prints a row of - characters once.


         blank abc



  prints 'abcabcabcabcabcabc....'This is really only of any use in a
  script file and you can print a maximumof 9 lines.

  11.16.  bye (0)

  bye Exit from the cluster

  This will disconnect you from the cluster

  11.17.  catchup <node call> all|[<msgno> ...] (5)

  catchup <node call> all|[<msgno> ...] Mark a message as sent


  11.18.  chat <group> <text> (0)

  chat <group> <text> Chat or Conference to a group

  It is now possible to JOIN a group and have network wide conferencing
  to thatgroup. DXSpider does not (and probably will not) implement the
  AK1A conference mode as this seems very limiting, is hardly used and
  doesn't seemto work too well anyway.This system uses the existing ANN
  system and is compatible with both otherDXSpider nodes and AK1A
  clusters (they use ANN/<group>). You can be a member of as many
  "groups" as you want. To join a group type:-


         JOIN FOC    (where FOC is the group name)



  To leave a group type:-


         LEAVE FOC



  You can see which groups you are in by typing:-


         STAT/USER



  and you can see whether your mate is in the group, if he connects to
  thesame node as you, by typing:-


         STAT/USER g1tlh



  To send a message to a group type:-


         CHAT FOC hello everyone



  or


         CH #9000 hello I am back


  See also JOIN, LEAVE, SHOW/CHAT

         acc/spot 1 on hf/cw  acc/spot 2 on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)



  and you say:-


         clear/spot 1



  you will be left with:-


         acc/spot 2 on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)



  If you do:


         clear/spot all



  the filter will be completely removed.

  11.25.  clear/wcy <callsign> [input] [0-9|all] (8)

  clear/wcy <callsign> [input] [0-9|all] Clear a WCY filter line

  A sysop can clear an input or normal output filter for a user or

  theDX cluster <callsign>. This process creates a new 'client' process
  which willuse the script in /spider/connect/<callsign> to effect the
  'chat' exchangenecessary to traverse the network(s) to logon to the
  cluster <callsign>.

  11.30.  dbavail (0)

  dbavail Show a list of all the Databases in the system

  Title says it all really, this command lists all the databases
  definedin the system. It is also aliased to SHOW/COMMAND.

  11.31.  dbcreate <name> (9)

  dbcreate <name> Create a database entry


  11.32.  dbcreate <name> chain <name> [<name>..] (9)

  dbcreate <name> chain <name> [<name>..] Create a chained database
  entry

  11.33.  dbcreate <name> cmd <dxspider command> (9)

  dbcreate <name> cmd <dxspider command> make a local command available
  as a DB

  DBCREATE allows you to define a database in the system. It doesn't
  actuallycreate anything, just defines it.The databases that are
  created are simple DB_File hash databases, they are therefore already
  'indexed'.You can define a local database with the first form of the
  command eg:


         DBCREATE oblast



  You can also chain databases with the addition of the 'chain' keyword.
  This will search each database one after the other. A typical example
  is:


         DBCREATE sdx_qsl chain sql_ad



  No checking is done to see if the any of the chained databases exist,
  infact it is usually better to do the above staement first then do
  each ofthe chained databases.Databases can exist offsite. To define a
  database that lives on another node do:


         DBCREATE buckmaster remote gb7dxc



  Remote databases cannot be chained; however, the last database in a a
  chain can be a remote database eg:


         DBCREATE qsl chain gb7dxc



  To see what databases have been defined do:


         DBAVAIL (or it will have been aliased to SHOW/COMMAND)



  It would be normal for you to add an entry into your local Aliases
  fileto allow people to use the 'SHOW/<dbname>' style syntax. So you
  wouldneed to add a line like:-


         's' => [    ..    ..    '^sh\w*/buc', 'dbshow buckmaster', 'dbshow',    ..    ..   ],



  to allow


         SH/BUCK g1tlh



  to work as they may be used to.You can also make local commands avail-
  able as 'pseudo' databases. Youcan therefore make spider special com-
  mands available as a database. Iimagine that this will be primarily
  useful for remote access from legacy nodes. For example:-


         DBCREATE dxqsl cmd show/dxqsl



  You also use one of these databases in a chain. This may be useful
  locally. See DBIMPORT for the importing of existing AK1A format data
  to databases.See DBSHOW for generic database enquiry

  11.34.  dbcreate <name> remote <node> (9)

  dbcreate <name> remote <node> Create a remote database entry


  11.35.  dbimport <dbname> <filename> (9)

  dbimport <dbname> <filename> Import AK1A data into a database

  If you want to import or update data in bulk to a database you can
  usethis command. It will either create or update entries into an
  existingdatabase. For example:-


         DBIMPORT oblast /tmp/OBLAST.FUL



  will import the standard OBLAST database that comes with AK1A into
  theoblast database held locally.

  11.36.  dbremove <dbname> (9)

  dbremove <dbname> Delete a database

  DBREMOVE will completely remove a database entry and also delete any
  datafile that is associated with it. There is no warning, no comeback,
  no safety net. For example:


         DBREMOVE oblast



  will remove the oblast database from the system and it will also
  removethe associated datafile.I repeat:There is no warning, no come-
  back, no safety net.You have been warned.

  11.37.  dbshow <dbname> <key> (0)

  dbshow <dbname> <key> Display an entry, if it exists, in a database

  This is the generic user interface to the database to the database
  system.It is expected that the sysop will add an entry to the local
  Aliases fileso that users can use the more familiar AK1A style of
  enquiry such as:


         SH/BUCK G1TLH



  but if he hasn't and the database really does exist (use DBAVAIL
  orSHOW/COMMAND to find out) you can do the same thing with:


         DBSHOW buck G1TLH



  11.38.  debug (9)

  debug Set the cluster program into debug mode

  Executing this command will only have an effect if you are running the
  clusterin debug mode i.e.


               perl -d cluster.pl



  It will interrupt the cluster just after the debug command has fin-
  ished.

  11.39.  delete/usdb <callsign> ... (9)

  delete/usdb <callsign> ... Delete this user from the US State Database

  This command will completely remove a one or more callsignsfrom the US
  States database.There is NO SECOND CHANCE.It goes without saying that
  you should use this command CAREFULLY!Note that these callsign may be
  re-instated by any weekly updates from the FCC.

  11.40.  delete/user <callsign> ... (9)

  delete/user <callsign> ... Delete this user from the User Database

  This command will completely remove a one or more users from the
  database.There is NO SECOND CHANCE.It goes without saying that you
  should use this command CAREFULLY!

  11.41.  demonstrate <call> <command> (9)

  demonstrate <call> <command> Demonstrate a command to another user

  This command is provided so that sysops can demonstrate commands to
  other users. It runs a command as though that user had typed it in
  andthen sends the output to that user, together with the command that
  caused it.


         DEMO g7brn sh/dx iota oc209  DEMO g1tlh set/here



  Note that this command is similar to SPOOF and will have the same
  sideeffects. Commands are run at the privilege of the user which is
  beingdemonstrated to.

  11.42.  directory (0)

  directory List messages



  11.43.  directory <from>-<to> (0)

  directory <from>-<to> List messages <from> message <to> message

  List the messages in the messages directory.If there is a 'p' one
  space after the message number then it is a personal message. If there
  is a '-' between the message number and the'p' then this indicates
  that the message has been read.You can use shell escape characters
  such as '*' and '?' in the <call>fields.You can combine some of the
  various directory commands together eg:-


          DIR TO G1TLH 5



  or


          DIR SUBJECT IOTA 200-250



  You can abbreviate all the commands to one letter and use ak1a syn-
  tax:-


          DIR/T G1* 10   DIR/S QSL 10-100 5



  11.44.  directory <nn> (0)

  directory <nn> List last <nn> messages


  11.45.  directory all (0)

  directory all List all messages


  11.46.  directory from <call> (0)

  directory from <call> List all messages from <call>


  11.47.  directory new (0)

  directory new List all new messages


  11.48.  directory own (0)

  directory own List your own messages


  11.49.  directory subject <string> (0)

  directory subject <string> List all messages with <string> in subject


  11.50.  directory to <call> (0)

  directory to <call> List all messages to <call>

  11.51.  directory- (5)

  directory-

  Sysops can see all users' messages.

  11.52.  disconnect <call> [<call> ...] (8)

  disconnect <call> [<call> ...] Disconnect a user or cluster

  Disconnect any <call> connected locally

  11.53.  dx [by <call>] <freq> <call> <remarks> (0)

  dx [by <call>] <freq> <call> <remarks> Send a DX spot

  This is how you send a DX Spot to other users. You can, in fact,
  nowenter the <freq> and the <call> either way round.


          DX FR0G 144.600   DX 144.600 FR0G   DX 144600 FR0G



  will all give the same result. You can add some remarks to the endof
  the command and they will be added to the spot.


          DX FR0G 144600 this is a test



  You can credit someone else by saying:-


          DX by G1TLH FR0G 144.600 he isn't on the cluster



  The <freq> is compared against the available bands set up in the clus-
  ter.  See SHOW/BANDS for more information.

  11.54.  echo <line> (0)

  echo <line> Echo the line to the output

  This command is useful in scripts and so forth for printing theline
  that you give to the command to the output. You can use thisin
  user_default scripts and the SAVE command for titling and so forthThe
  script will interpret certain standard "escape" sequences as follows:-


         \t - becomes a TAB character (0x09 in ascii)  \a - becomes a BEEP character (0x07 in ascii)  \n - prints a new line



  So the following example:-


         echo GB7DJK is a dxcluster



  produces:-


    GB7DJK is a dxcluster



  on the output. You don't need a \n on the end of the line you want to
  send.A more complex example:-


         echo GB7DJK\n\tg1tlh\tDirk\n\tg3xvf\tRichard



  produces:-


         GB7DJK          g1tlh   Dirk          g3xvf   Richard



  on the output.

  11.55.  export <msgno> <filename> (9)

  export <msgno> <filename> Export a message to a file

  Export a message to a file. This command can only be executed on a
  localconsole with a fully privileged user. The file produced will be
  in a formready to be imported back into the cluster by placing it in
  the import directory (/spider/msg/import).This command cannot
  overwrite an existing file. This is to provide some measure of
  security. Any files written will owned by the same user as the main
  cluster, otherwise you can put the new files anywhere the cluster
  canaccess. For example:-


         EXPORT 2345 /tmp/a



  11.56.  export_users [<filename>] (9)

  export_users [<filename>] Export the users database to ascii

  Export the users database to a file in ascii format. If no filenameis
  given then it will export the file to /spider/data/user_asc.If the
  file already exists it will be renamed to <filename>.o. In factup to 5
  generations of the file can be kept each one with an extra 'o' on
  thesuffix. BE WARNED: this will write to any file you have write
  access to. No check ismade on the filename (if any) that you specify.

  11.57.  filtering... (0)

  filtering... Filtering things in DXSpider

  There are a number of things you can filter in the DXSpider system.
  Theyall use the same general mechanism.In general terms you can create
  a 'reject' or an 'accept' filter whichcan have up to 10 lines in it.
  You do this using, for example:-


         accept/spots .....  reject/spots .....



  where ..... are the specific commands for that type of filter. There-
  are filters for spots, wwv, announce, wcy and (for sysops)connects.
  See each different accept or reject command reference formore
  details.There is also a command to clear out one or more lines in a
  filter andone to show you what you have set. They are:-


         clear/spots 1  clear/spots all



  and


         show/filter



  There is clear/xxxx command for each type of filter.For now we are
  going to use spots for the examples, but you can applythe principles
  to all types of filter.There are two main types of filter 'accept' or
  'reject'; which you usedepends entirely on how you look at the world
  and what is leastwriting to achieve what you want. Each filter has 10
  lines (of anylength) which are tried in order. If a line matches then
  the actionyou have specified is taken (ie reject means ignore it and
  acceptmeans gimme it).The important thing to remember is that if you
  specify a 'reject'filter (all the lines in it say 'reject/spots' (for
  instance)) then ifa spot comes in that doesn't match any of the lines
  then you will getit BUT if you specify an 'accept' filter then any
  spots that don'tmatch are dumped. For example if I have a one line
  accept filter:-


         accept/spots on vhf and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)



  then automatically you will ONLY get VHF spots from or to CQ zones
  1415 and 16.  If you set a reject filter like:


         reject/spots on hf/cw



  Then you will get everything EXCEPT HF CW spots, If you am interested
  in IOTAand will work it even on CW then you could say:-


         reject/spots on hf/cw and not info iota



  But in that case you might only be interested in iota and say:-


         accept/spots not on hf/cw or info iota



  which is exactly the same. You should choose one or the other untilyou
  are confortable with the way it works. Yes, you can mix them(actually
  you can have an accept AND a reject on the same line) butdon't try
  this at home until you can analyse the results that you getwithout
  ringing up the sysop for help.Another useful addition now is filtering
  by US state
         accept/spots by_state VA,NH,RI,ME



  You can arrange your filter lines into logical units, either for
  yourown understanding or simply convenience. I have one set fre-
  quently:-


         reject/spots 1 on hf/cw  reject/spots 2 on 50000/1400000 not (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)



  What this does is to ignore all HF CW spots (being a class B I
  can'tread any CW and couldn't possibly be interested in HF :-) and
  alsorejects any spots on VHF which don't either originate or spot
  someonein Europe.This is an exmaple where you would use the line num-
  ber (1 and 2 inthis case), if you leave the digit out, the system
  assumes '1'. Digits'0'-'9' are available.You can leave the word 'and'
  out if you want, it is implied. You canuse any number of brackets to
  make the 'expression' as you wantit. There are things called prece-
  dence rules working here which meanthat you will NEED brackets in a
  situation like line 2 because,without it, will assume:-


         (on 50000/1400000 and by_zone 14,15,16) or call_zone 14,15,16



  annoying, but that is the way it is. If you use OR - usebrackets.
  Whilst we are here CASE is not important. 'And BY_Zone' isjust 'and
  by_zone'.If you want to alter your filter you can just redefine one or
  morelines of it or clear out one line. For example:-


         reject/spots 1 on hf/ssb



  or


         clear/spots 1



  To remove the filter in its entirty:-


         clear/spots all



  There are similar CLEAR commands for the other filters:-


         clear/announce  clear/wcy  clear/wwv



  ADVANCED USERS:-Once you are happy with the results you get, you may
  like to experiment. my example that filters hf/cw spots and accepts
  vhf/uhf spots from EUcan be written with a mixed filter, eg:



    rej/spot on hf/cw  acc/spot on 0/30000  acc/spot 2 on 50000/1400000 and (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)



  each filter slot actually has a 'reject' slot and an 'accept'slot. The
  reject slot is executed BEFORE the accept slot.It was mentioned ear-
  lier that after a reject test that doesn't match,the default for fol-
  lowing tests is 'accept', the reverse is true for'accept'. In the
  example what happens is that the reject is executedfirst, any non
  hf/cw spot is passed to the accept line, which letsthru everything
  else on HF.The next filter line lets through just VHF/UHF spots from
  EU.

  11.58.  forward/latlong <node_call> (8)

  forward/latlong <node_call> Send latitude and longitude information to
  another cluster

  This command sends all the latitude and longitude information that
  yourcluster is holding against callsigns.  One advantage of recieving
  thisinformation is that more locator information is held by you.
  Thismeans that more locators are given on the DX line assuming you
  haveSET/DXGRID enabled.  This could be a LOT of information though,
  soit is not recommended on slow links.

  11.59.  forward/opernam <call> (1)

  forward/opernam <call> Send out information on this <call> to all
  clusters

  This command sends out any information held in the user file which can
  be broadcast in PC41 protocol packets. This information is Name, QTH,
  Locationand Homenode. PC41s are only sent for the information that is
  available.

  11.60.  help (0)

  help The HELP Command

  HELP is available for a number of commands. The syntax is:-


         HELP <cmd>



  Where <cmd> is the name of the command you want help on.All commands
  can be abbreviated, so SHOW/DX can be abbreviatedto SH/DX, ANNOUNCE
  can be shortened to AN and so on.Look at the APROPOS <string> command
  which will search the help databasefor the <string> you specify and
  give you a list of likely commandsto look at with HELP.

  11.61.  init <node> (5)

  init <node> Re-initialise a link to an AK1A compatible node

  This command attempts to re-initialise a link to a (usually) AK1A
  nodethat has got confused, usually by a protocol loop of some kind. It
  maywork - but you usually will be better off simply disconnecting it
  (orbetter, if it is a real AK1A node, doing an RCMD <node> DISC/F
  <yournode>).Best of luck - you will need it.

  11.62.  join <group> (0)

  join <group> Join a chat or conference group

  JOIN allows you to join a network wide conference group. To join
  agroup (called FOC in this case) type:-


         JOIN FOC



  See also CHAT, LEAVE, SHOW/CHAT

  11.63.  kill (5)

  kill

  As a sysop you can kill any message on the system.

  You can get rid of any message to or originating from your callsign
  using this command. You can remove more than one message at a time.

  11.68.  kill expunge <msgno> [<msgno..] (6)

  kill expunge <msgno> [<msgno..] Expunge a message

  Deleting a message using the normal KILL commands only marks that
  messagefor deletion. The actual deletion only happens later (usually
  two days later).The KILL EXPUNGE command causes the message to be
  truly deleted more or lessimmediately.It otherwise is used in the same
  way as the KILL command.

  11.69.  kill from <call> (5)

  kill from <call> Remove all messages from a callsign


  11.70.  kill full <msgno> [<msgno..] (5)

  kill full <msgno> [<msgno..] Delete a message from the whole cluster

  Delete a message from the local system. You will only be able todelete
  messages that you have originated or been sent (unless you arethe
  sysop).


         KILL 1234-1255



  Will delete all the messages that you own between msgnos 1234 and
  1255.


         KILL from g1tlh



  will delete all the messages from g1tlh (if you are g1tlh). Similarly:


         KILL to g1tlh



  will delete all messages to g1tlh.


         KILL FULL 1234



  will delete a message (usually a 'bulletin') from the whole cluster
  system. This uses the subject field, so any messages that have exactly
  thesame subject will be deleted. Beware!

  11.71.  kill full <msgno> [<msgno] (5)

  kill full <msgno> [<msgno] Remove a message from the entire cluster

  Remove this message from the entire cluster system as well as your
  node.

  11.72.  kill to <call> (5)

  kill to <call> Remove all messages to a callsign

  kill to <regex> Delete messages TO a callsign or pattern


  11.75.  leave <group> (0)

  leave <group> Leave a chat or conference group

  LEAVE allows you to leave a network wide conference group. To leave
  agroup (called FOC in this case) type:-


         LEAVE FOC



  See also CHAT, JOIN, SHOW/CHAT

  11.76.  links (0)

  links Show which nodes is physically connected

  This is a quick listing that shows which links are connected andsome
  information about them. See WHO for a list of all connections.

  11.77.  load/aliases (9)

  load/aliases Reload the command alias table

  Reload the /spider/cmd/Aliases file after you have editted it. Youwill
  need to do this if you change this file whilst the cluster isrunning
  in order for the changes to take effect.

  11.78.  load/badmsg (9)

  load/badmsg Reload the bad msg table

  Reload the /spider/msg/badmsg.pl file if you have changed it manually
  whilstthe cluster is running. This table contains a number of perl
  regular expressions which are searched for in the fields targetted of
  each message. If any of them match then that message is immediately
  deleted on receipt.

  11.79.  load/badwords (9)

  load/badwords Reload the bad words table

  Reload the /spider/data/badwords file if you have changed it manually
  whilstthe cluster is running. This file contains a list of words
  which, if foundon certain text portions of PC protocol, will cause
  those protocol framesto be rejected. It will all put out a message if
  any of these words areused on the announce, dx and talk commands. The
  words can be one or more on a line, lines starting with '#' are
  ignored.

  11.80.  load/bands (9)

  load/bands Reload the band limits table

  Reload the /spider/data/bands.pl file if you have changed it manually
  whilstthe cluster is running.

  11.81.  load/cmd_cache (9)

  load/cmd_cache Reload the automatic command cache

  Normally, if you change a command file in the cmd or local_cmd tree
  itwill automatially be picked up by the cluster program. Sometimes
  itcan get confused if you are doing a lot of moving commands about
  ordelete a command in the local_cmd tree and want to use the normal
  oneagain. Execute this command to reset everything back to the state
  itwas just after a cluster restart.

  11.82.  load/forward (9)

  load/forward Reload the msg forwarding routing table

  Reload the /spider/msg/forward.pl file if you have changed itmanually
  whilst the cluster is running.

  11.83.  load/keps (5)

  load/keps Load new keps data



  11.84.  load/keps [nn] (5)

  load/keps [nn] Load new keps data from message

  If there is no message number then reload the current Keps data
  fromthe Keps.pm data file. You create this file by running


        /spider/perl/convkeps.pl <filename>



  on a file containing NASA 2 line keps as a message issued by AMSAT. If
  there is a message number, then it will take the message, runcon-
  vkeps.pl on it and then load the data, all in one step.These messages
  are sent to ALL by GB7DJK (and others) from time to time.

  11.85.  load/messages (9)

  load/messages Reload the system messages file

  If you change the /spider/perl/Messages file (usually
  whilstfiddling/writing new commands) you can have them take effect
  during acluster session by executing this command. You need to do this
  if getsomething like :-unknown message 'xxxx' in lang 'en'

  11.86.  load/prefixes (9)

  load/prefixes Reload the prefix table

  Reload the /spider/data/prefix_data.pl file if you have changed
  itmanually whilst the cluster is running.

  11.87.  merge <node> [<no spots>/<no wwv>] (5)

  merge <node> [<no spots>/<no wwv>] Ask for the latest spots and WWV

  MERGE allows you to bring your spot and wwv database up to date. By
  defaultit will request the last 10 spots and 5 WWVs from the node you
  select. The node must be connected locally.You can request any number
  of spots or wwv and although they will be appendedto your databases
  they will not duplicate any that have recently been added (the last 2
  days for spots and last month for WWV data).

  11.88.  msg <cmd> <msgno> [data ... ] (9)

  msg <cmd> <msgno> [data ... ] Alter various message parameters

  Alter message parameters like To, From, Subject, whether private or
  bulletinor return receipt (RR) is required or whether to keep this
  message from timingout.


         MSG TO <msgno> <call>     - change TO callsign to <call>  MSG FRom <msgno> <call>   - change FROM callsign to <call>  MSG PRrivate <msgno>      - set private flag  MSG NOPRrivate <msgno>    - unset private flag  MSG RR <msgno>            - set RR flag  MSG NORR <msgno>          - unset RR flag  MSG KEep <msgno>          - set the keep flag (message won't be deleted ever)  MSG NOKEep <msgno>        - unset the keep flag  MSG SUbject <msgno> <new> - change the subject to <new>  MSG WAittime <msgno>      - remove any waitting time for this message  MSG NOREad <msgno>        - mark message as unread  MSG REad <msgno>          - mark message as read  MSG QUeue                 - queue any outstanding bulletins  MSG QUeue 1               - queue any outstanding private messages



  You can look at the status of a message by using:-


         STAT/MSG <msgno>



  This will display more information on the message than DIR does.

  11.89.  pc <call> <text> (8)

  pc <call> <text> Send arbitrary text to a connected callsign

  Send some arbitrary text to a locally connected callsign. Noprocessing
  is done on the text. This command allows you to send PCProtocol to
  unstick things if problems arise (messages get stucketc). eg:-


          pc gb7djk PC33^GB7TLH^GB7DJK^400^



  or


          pc G1TLH Try doing that properly!!!



  Send any text you like to the callsign requested. This is used mainly
  to sendPC protocol to connected nodes either for testing or to unstick
  things. You can also use in the same way as a talk command to a con-
  nected user butwithout any processing, added of "from <blah> to <blah"
  or whatever.

  11.90.  ping <node call> (1)

  ping <node call> Check the link quality between nodes

  This command allows you to send a frame to another cluster node onthe
  network and get a return frame.  The time it takes to do thisis a good
  indication of the quality of the link.  The actual timeit takes is
  output to the console in seconds.Any visible cluster node can be
  PINGed.

  11.91.  rcmd <node call> <cmd> (1)

  rcmd <node call> <cmd> Send a command to another DX Cluster

  This command allows you to send nearly any command to another DX
  Clusternode that is connected to the system. Whether you get any
  output is dependant on a) whether the other system knowsthat the node
  callsign of this cluster is in fact a node b) whether theother system
  is allowing RCMDs from this node and c) whether you havepermission to
  send this command at all.

  11.92.  read (0)

  read Read the next unread personal message addressed to you


  11.93.  read <msgno> (0)

  read <msgno> Read the specified message

  You can read any messages that are sent as 'non-personal' and also
  anymessage either sent by or sent to your callsign.

  11.94.  read- (5)

  read-

  As a sysop you may read any message on the system


  11.95.  reject (0)

  reject Set a filter to reject something

  Create a filter to reject somethingThere are 2 types of filter, accept
  and reject.  See HELP FILTERING for moreinfo.

  11.96.  reject/announce <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> (8)

  reject/announce <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> Announce filter sysop
  version

  This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as
  thedefault for nodes and users eg:-


         reject/ann by G,M,2  reject/ann input node_default by G,M,2  reject/ann user_default by G,M,2



  11.97.  reject/announce [0-9] <pattern> (0)

  reject/announce [0-9] <pattern> Set a 'reject' filter line for
  announce

  Create an 'reject this announce' line for a filter. A reject filter
  line means that if the announce matches this filter it ispassed onto
  the user. See HELP FILTERING for more info. Please read thisto
  understand how filters work - it will save a lot of grief later on.You
  can use any of the following things in this line:-


         info <string>            eg: iota or qsl  by <prefixes>            eg: G,M,2           origin <prefixes>  origin_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)  origin_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW  origin_zone <prefixes or numbers>  origin_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,ME  by_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>  by_itu <prefixes or numbers>  by_zone <prefixes or numbers>  by_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,ME  channel <prefixes>  wx 1                     filter WX announces  dest <prefixes>          eg: 6MUK,WDX      (distros)



  some examples:-


         rej/ann by_zone 14,15,16 and not by G,M,2



  You can use the tag 'all' to reject everything eg:


         rej/ann all

  reject/route <call> [0-9] <pattern> Set an 'reject' filter line for
  routing

  Create an 'reject this routing PC Protocol' line for a filter. An
  reject filter line means that if a PC16/17/19/21/24/41/50 matches this
  filter it is NOT passed thru that interface. See HELP FILTERING for
  more info. Please read this to understand how filters work - it will
  save a lot of grief later on.You can use any of the following things
  in this line:-


    call <prefixes>        the callsign of the thingy  call_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)  call_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW  call_zone <prefixes or numbers>  call_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,ME  origin <prefixes>      really the interface it came in on  origin_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)  origin_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW  origin_zone <prefixes or numbers>  origin_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,ME



  some examples:-


         rej/route gb7djk call_dxcc 61,38 (everything except  UK+EIRE nodes)



  You can use the tag 'all' to reject everything eg:


         rej/route all     (equiv to [very] restricted mode)



  as with ACCEPT/ROUTE 'by' is now a synonym for 'call'.

  11.99.  reject/spots <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> (8)

  reject/spots <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> Spot filter sysop version

  This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as
  thedefault for nodes and users eg:-


         reject/spot db0sue-7 1 by_zone 14,15,16  reject/spot node_default all  set/hops node_default 10



         reject/spot user_default by G,M,2



  11.100.  reject/spots [0-9] <pattern> (0)

  reject/spots [0-9] <pattern> Set a 'reject' filter line for spots

  Create a 'reject this spot' line for a filter. A reject filter line
  means that if the spot matches this filter it isdumped (not passed
  on). See HELP FILTERING for more info. Please read thisto understand
  how filters work - it will save a lot of grief later on.You can use
  any of the following things in this line:-


         freq <range>           eg: 0/30000 or hf or hf/cw or 6m,4m,2m  on <range>             same as 'freq'  call <prefixes>        eg: G,PA,HB9  info <string>          eg: iota or qsl  by <prefixes>              call_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)  call_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW  call_zone <prefixes or numbers>  call_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,ME  by_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>  by_itu <prefixes or numbers>  by_zone <prefixes or numbers>  by_state <states>                eg: VA,NH,RI,ME  origin <prefixes>  channel <prefixes>



         rej/spot 1 on hf  rej/spot 2 on vhf and not (by_zone 14,15,16 or call_zone 14,15,16)



  You can use the tag 'all' to reject everything eg:


         rej/spot 3 all

  11.101.  reject/wcy <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> (8)

  reject/wcy <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> WCY filter sysop version

  This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as
  thedefault for nodes and users eg:-


         reject/wcy gb7djk all



  11.102.  reject/wcy [0-9] <pattern> (0)

  reject/wcy [0-9] <pattern> set a 'reject' WCY filter

  It is unlikely that you will want to do this, but if you do then you
  canfilter on the following fields:-


         by <prefixes>            eg: G,M,2           origin <prefixes>  origin_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)  origin_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW  origin_zone <prefixes or numbers>  by_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>  by_itu <prefixes or numbers>  by_zone <prefixes or numbers>  channel <prefixes>



  There are no examples because WCY Broadcasts only come from one place
  andyou either want them or not (see UNSET/WCY if you don't want
  them).This command is really provided for future use.See HELP FILTER
  for information.

  11.103.  reject/wwv <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> (8)

  reject/wwv <call> [input] [0-9] <pattern> WWV filter sysop version

  This version allows a sysop to set a filter for a callsign as well as
  thedefault for nodes and users eg:-


         reject/wwv db0sue-7 1 by_zone 4  reject/wwv node_default all



         reject/wwv user_default by W



  11.104.  reject/wwv [0-9] <pattern> (0)

  reject/wwv [0-9] <pattern> set a 'reject' WWV filter

  It is unlikely that you will want to do this, but if you do then you
  canfilter on the following fields:-


         by <prefixes>            eg: G,M,2           origin <prefixes>  origin_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>    eg: 61,62 (from eg: sh/pre G)  origin_itu <prefixes or numbers>     or: G,GM,GW  origin_zone <prefixes or numbers>  by_dxcc <prefixes or numbers>  by_itu <prefixes or numbers>  by_zone <prefixes or numbers>  channel <prefixes>



  for example


    reject/wwv by_zone 14,15,16



  is probably the only useful thing to do (which will only show WWV
  broadcastsby stations in the US).See HELP FILTER for information.

  11.109.  reply rr <msgno> (0)

  reply rr <msgno> Reply to the specified message with read receipt

  You can reply to a message and the subject will automatically
  have"Re:" inserted in front of it, if it isn't already present.You can
  also use all the extra qualifiers such as RR, PRIVATE, NOPRIVATE, B
  that you can use with the SEND command (see SENDfor further details)

  11.110.  save [-d -t -a] <filename> "<cmd>" [...] (9)

  save [-d -t -a] <filename> "<cmd>" [...] Save command output to a file

  This sysop only cammand allows you to save the output of one or
  morecommands to a file. For example:-


         save /spider/packclus/dxstats show/dxstat



  will save the output of the normal command "show/dxstat" to the
  file"dxstats" in the files area.You can have some extra flags to the
  save which will either date stamp or time stamp or both the filename
  so:-


         save -d /tmp/a <cmd> creates /tmp/a_6-Jan-2002  save -t /tmp/a <cmd> creates /tmp/a_2301Z  save -d -t /tmp/a <cmd> creates /tmp/a_6-Jan-2002_2301Z



  The -a flag means append to the file instead of overwriting it.You can
  have more than one command on the line, to do this you MUSTenclose
  each command in double quotes (") eg:-


         save /tmp/a "sh/hfstats" "blank +" "sh/vhfstats"


  or


         save /tmp/a "sh/hfstats","blank +","sh/vhfstats"



  You can only write into places that the cluster has permission for
  (whichis that of the "sysop" user [which had BETTER NOT BE "root"]),
  you will need to create any directories you want to put stuff in
  beforehand as well.It is likely that you will want to run these com-
  mands in a crontab type situation. You would do that something like:-


         0 0 * * * run_cmd('save /tmp/dxstats "echo DXStat Table", "sh/dxstats"')



  Note that you still enclose each command with (") characters but you
  mustenclose the entire save command in (') characters. Now in fact,
  this can be varied if you know what you are doing. See theadmin manual
  for more details.

  11.111.  send <call> [<call> ...] (0)

  send copy <msgno> <call> Send a copy of a  message to someone


  11.113.  send noprivate <call> (0)

  send noprivate <call> Send a message to all stations

  All the SEND commands will create a message which will be sent either
  toan individual callsign or to one of the 'bulletin' addresses. SEND
  <call> on its own acts as though you had typed SEND PRIVATE, that isit
  will mark the message as personal and send it to the cluster node
  thatthat callsign is connected to. If the <call> you have specified is
  in facta known bulletin category on your node (eg: ALL) then the
  message shouldautomatically become a bulletin.You can have more than
  one callsign in all of the SEND commands.You can have multiple
  qualifiers so that you can have for example:-


         SEND RR COPY 123 PRIVATE G1TLH G0RDI



  which should send a copy of message 123 to G1TLH and G0RDI and you
  willreceive a read receipt when they have read the message.SB is an
  alias for SEND NOPRIVATE (or send a bulletin in BBS speak)SP is an
  alias for SEND PRIVATEThe system will ask you for a subject. Conven-
  tionally this should be no longer than 29 characters for compatibil-
  ity. Most modern clustersoftware should accept more.You will now be
  prompted to start entering your text. You finish the message by enter-
  ing '/EX' on a new line. For instance:


         ...  bye then Jim  73 Dirk  /ex



  If you have started a message and you don't want to keep it then you-
  can abandon the message with '/ABORT' on a new line, like:-


         line 1  line 2  oh I just can't be bothered with this  /abort



  If you abort the message it will NOT be sent.When you are entering the
  text of your message, most normal output (suchas DX announcements and
  so on are suppressed and stored for latter display(upto 20 such lines
  are stored, as new ones come along, so the oldestlines are
  dropped).Also, you can enter normal commands commands (and get the
  output immediately) whilst in the middle of a message. You do this by
  typingthe command preceeded by a '/' character on a new line, so:-


         /dx g1tlh 144010 strong signal



  Will issue a dx annoucement to the rest of the cluster. Also, you can
  add the output of a command to your message by preceeding the command
  with '//', thus :-


         //sh/vhftable



  This will show YOU the output from SH/VHFTABLE and also store it in
  themessage. You can carry on with the message until you are ready to
  send it.

  11.145.  set/obscount <count> <call> (8)

  set/obscount <count> <call> Set the 'pump-up' obscelence PING counter

  From 1.35 onwards neighbouring nodes are pinged at regular intervals
  (seeSET/PINGINTERVAL), usually 300 seconds or 5 minutes. There is a
  'pump-up'counter which is decremented on every outgoing ping and then
  reset tothe 'obscount' value on every incoming ping. The default value
  of thisparameter is 2. What this means is that a neighbouring node
  will be pinged twice at (default) 300 second intervals and if no reply
  has been heard just beforewhat would be the third attempt, that node
  is disconnected.If a ping is heard then the obscount is reset to the
  full value. Usingdefault values, if a node has not responded to a ping
  within 15 minutes,it is disconnected.You can set this parameter
  between 1 and 9.It is STRONGLY recommended that you don't change the
  default.

  11.146.  set/page <lines per page> (0)

  set/page <lines per page> Set the lines per page

  Tell the system how many lines you wish on a page when the number of
  lineof output from a command is more than this. The default is 20.
  Setting itexplicitly to 0 will disable paging.


         SET/PAGE 30  SET/PAGE 0



  The setting is stored in your user profile.

  11.147.  set/password (0)

  set/password Set your own password

  This command only works for a 'telnet' user (currently). It willonly
  work if you have a password already set. This initial passwordcan only
  be set by the sysop.When you execute this command it will ask you for
  your old password,then ask you to type in your new password twice (to
  make sure youget it right). You may or may not see the data echoed on
  the screenas you type, depending on the type of telnet client you
  have.



  11.148.  set/password <callsign> <string> (9)

  set/password <callsign> <string> Set a users password

  The password for a user can only be set by a full sysop. The stringcan
  contain any characters. The way this field is used depends on context.
  If it is being used inthe SYSOP command context then you are offered 5
  random numbers and youhave to supply the corresponding letters. This
  is now mainly for ax25connections.If it is being used on incoming
  telnet connections then, if a passwordis set or the:


         set/var $main::passwdreq = 1



  command is executed in the startup script, then a password prompt
  isgiven after the normal 'login: ' prompt.

  11.149.  set/pinginterval <time> <nodecall> (9)

  set/pinginterval <time> <nodecall> Set ping time to neighbouring nodes

  As from release 1.35 all neighbouring nodes are pinged at regular
  intervalsin order to determine the rolling quality of the link and, in
  future, toaffect routing decisions. The default interval is 300 secs
  or 5 minutes.You can use this command to set a different interval.
  Please don't. But if you do the value you enter is treated as minutes
  up 30 and secondsfor numbers greater than that.This is used also to
  help determine when a link is down at the far end(as certain cluster
  software doesn't always notice), see SET/OBSCOUNTfor more
  information.If you must change it (and it may be useful for internet
  connected nodeson dynamic IP addresses that go away after a set time
  of usage) the timecan be specified as:-


         5      which if less than 30 is converted to minutes otherwise is          taken as the no of seconds between pings.   120s   120 seconds  5m     5 minutes  1h     1 hour



  Please be aware that this causes traffic to occur on the link, setting
  this value too low may annoy your neighbours beyond the point of
  endurance!You can switch this off by setting it to 0.

  11.150.  set/privilege <n> <call> [<call..] (9)

  set/privilege <n> <call> [<call..] Set privilege level on a call

  Set the privilege level on a callsign. The privilege levels that
  pertainto commands are as default:-


         0 - normal user  1 - allow remote nodes normal user RCMDs  5 - various privileged commands (including shutdown, but not disc-      connect), the normal level for another node.  8 - more privileged commands (including disconnect)  9 - local sysop privilege. DO NOT SET ANY REMOTE USER OR NODE TO THIS      LEVEL.



  If you are a sysop and you come in as a normal user on a remote con-
  nectionyour privilege will automatically be set to 0.

  11.151.  set/prompt <string> (0)

  set/prompt <string> Set your prompt to <string>



  11.152.  set/qra <locator> (0)

  set/qra <locator> Set your QRA Grid locator

  Tell the system what your QRA (or Maidenhead) locator is. If you have
  notdone a SET/LOCATION then your latitude and longitude will be set
  roughlycorrectly (assuming your locator is correct ;-). For example:-


         SET/QRA JO02LQ



  11.153.  set/qth <your qth> (0)

  set/qth <your qth> Set your QTH

  andfed new style DX Protocol rather normal user commands.

  11.156.  set/sys_location <lat & long> (9)

  set/sys_location <lat & long> Set your cluster latitude and longitude

  In order to get accurate headings and such like you must tell the
  systemwhat your latitude and longitude is. If you have not yet done a
  SET/QRAthen this command will set your QRA locator for you. For
  example:-


         SET/LOCATION 52 22 N 0 57 E



  11.157.  set/sys_qra <locator> (9)

  This command allows you to see all the users that can be seenand the
  nodes to which they are connected.This command is normally abbreviated
  to: sh/cNormally, the list returned will be just for the nodes from
  your country (because the list otherwise will be very long).


         SH/C ALL



  will produce a complete list of all nodes. BE WARNED: the list that is
  returned can be VERY longIt is possible to supply a node or part of a
  prefix and you will get a list of the users for that node or list of
  nodes starting withthat prefix.

  11.173.  show/date [<prefix>|<callsign>] (0)

  show/date [<prefix>|<callsign>] Show the local time

  This is very nearly the same as SHOW/TIME, the only difference the
  formatof the date string if no arguments are given.If no prefixes or
  callsigns are given then this command returns the localtime and UTC as
  the computer has it right now. If you give some prefixesthen it will
  show UTC and UTC + the local offset (not including DST) atthe prefixes
  or callsigns that you specify.

  11.174.  show/db0sdx <callsign> (0)

  show/db0sdx <callsign> Show QSL infomation from DB0SDX database

  This command queries the DB0SDX QSL server on the internetand returns
  any information available for that callsign. This serviceis provided
  for users of this software by http://www.qslinfo.de.See also SHOW/QRZ,
  SHOW/WM7D.

  11.175.  show/debug (9)

  show/debug Show what levels of debug information you are logging


  11.176.  show/dx (0)

  show/dx Interrogate the spot database

  If you just type SHOW/DX you will get the last so many spots(sysop
  configurable, but usually 10).In addition you can add any number of
  these commands in very nearlyany order to the basic SHOW/DX command,
  they are:-


        on <band>       - eg 160m 20m 2m 23cm 6mm on <region>     - eg hf vhf uhf shf      (see SHOW/BANDS) on <from>/<to>  - eg 1000/4000 14000-30000  (in Khz)    <from>-<to>



        <number>        - the number of spots you want <from>-<to>     - <from> spot no <to> spot no in the selected list <from>/<to>



        <prefix>        - for a spotted callsign beginning with <prefix> *<suffix>       - for a spotted callsign ending in <suffix> *<string>*      - for a spotted callsign containing <string>



        day <number>    - starting <number> days ago day <from>-<to> - <from> days <to> days ago     <from>/<to>



        info <text>     - any spots containing <text> in the info or remarks



   by <call>       - any spots spotted by <call> (spotter <call> is the                    same).



        qsl             - this automatically looks for any qsl info on the call                   held in the spot database.



        iota [<iota>]   - If the iota island number is missing it will look for                  the string iota and anything which looks like an iota                  island number. If you specify then it will look for                    that island.



        qra [<locator>] - this will look for the specific locator if you specify                   one or else anything that looks like a locator.



        dxcc            - treat the prefix as a 'country' and look for spots                   from that country regardless of actual prefix.                   eg dxcc oq2



                          You can also use this with the 'by' keyword so                    eg by W dxcc



        e.g.



          SH/DX 9m0   SH/DX on 20m info iota   SH/DX 9a on vhf day 30   SH/DX rf1p qsl   SH/DX iota    SH/DX iota eu-064   SH/DX qra jn86   SH/DX dxcc oq2   SH/DX dxcc oq2 by w dxcc



  11.177.  show/dxcc <prefix> (0)

  show/dxcc <prefix> Interrogate the spot database by country

  This command takes the <prefix> (which can be a full or partial
  callsign if desired), looks up which internal country number it isand
  then displays all the spots as per SH/DX for that country.This is now
  an alias for 'SHOW/DX DXCC' The options for SHOW/DX also apply to this
  command.   e.g.


          SH/DXCC G   SH/DXCC W on 20m iota



  This can be done with the SHOW/DX command like this:-



     SH/DX dxcc g   SH/DX dxcc w on 20m iota



  11.178.  show/dxqsl <callsign> (0)

  show/dxqsl <callsign> Show any QSL info gathered from spots

  The node collects information from the comment fields in spots
  (thingslike 'VIA EA7WA' or 'QSL-G1TLH') and stores these in a
  database.This command allows you to interrogate that database and if
  the callsignis found will display the manager(s) that people have
  spotted. This information is NOT reliable, but it is normally
  reasonably accurate ifit is spotted enough times.For example:-


         sh/dxqsl 4k9w



  You can check the raw input spots yourself with:-


         sh/dx 4k9w qsl



  This gives you more background information.

  11.179.  show/dxstats [days] [date] (0)

  show/dxstats [days] [date] Show the DX Statistics

  show/files [<filearea> [<string>]] List the contents of a filearea

  SHOW/FILES on its own will show you a list of the various
  fileareasavailable on the system. To see the contents of a particular
  filearea type:-


          SH/FILES <filearea>



  where <filearea> is the name of the filearea you want to see the con-
  tents of.You can also use shell globbing characters like '*' and '?'
  in astring to see a selection of files in a filearea eg:-


          SH/FILES bulletins arld*



  See also TYPE - to see the contents of a file.

  11.181.  show/filter (0)

  show/hftable [days] [date] [prefix ...] Show the HF DX Spotter Table

  Show the HF DX Spotter table for the list of prefixes for the last
  <days> no of days (default is 31), starting from a <date> (default:
  today).If there are no prefixes then it will show the table for your
  country.Remember that some countries have more than one "DXCC country"
  in them(eg G :-), to show them (assuming you are not in G already
  which isspecially treated in the code) you must list all the relevant
  prefixes


         sh/hftable g gm gd gi gj gw gu



  Note that the prefixes are converted into country codes so you don't
  haveto list all possible prefixes for each country.If you want more or
  less days than the default simply include thenumber you require:-


         sh/hftable 20 pa



  If you want to start at a different day, simply add the date in some
  recognizable form:-


         sh/hftable 2 25nov02  sh/hftable 2 25-nov-02   sh/hftable 2 021125   sh/hftable 2 25/11/02



  This will show the stats for your DXCC for that CQWW contest weekend.
  You can specify either prefixes or full callsigns (so you can see how
  youdid against all your mates). You can also say 'all' which will then
  printthe worldwide statistics.


         sh/hftable all



  11.184.  show/hops <call> [ann|spots|route|wcy|wwv] (8)

  11.188.  show/moon [ndays] [<prefix>|<callsign>] (0)

  show/moon [ndays] [<prefix>|<callsign>] Show Moon rise and set times

  Show the Moon rise and set times for a (list of) prefixes or
  callsigns, together with the azimuth and elevation of the sun
  currently at thoselocations.If you don't specify any prefixes or
  callsigns, it will show the times foryour QTH (assuming you have set
  it with either SET/LOCATION or SET/QRA),together with the current
  azimuth and elevation.In addition, it will show the illuminated
  fraction of the moons disk.If all else fails it will show the Moonrise
  and set times for the nodethat you are connected to. For example:-


         SH/MOON  SH/MOON G1TLH W5UN



  You can also use this command to see into the past or the future, soif
  you want to see yesterday's times then do:-


         SH/MOON -1



  or in three days time:-


         SH/MOON +3 W9



  Upto 366 days can be checked both in the past and in the future.Please
  note that the rise and set times are given as the UT times of rise and
  set on the requested UT day.

  11.189.  show/muf <prefix> [<hours>][long] (0)

  show/muf <prefix> [<hours>][long] Show the likely propagation to a
  prefix

  This command allow you to estimate the likelihood of you contactinga
  station with the prefix you have specified. The output assumes a
  modestpower of 20dBW and receiver sensitivity of -123dBm (about
  0.15muV/10dB SINAD)The result predicts the most likely operating
  frequencies and signallevels for high frequency (shortwave) radio
  propagation paths onspecified days of the year and hours of the day.
  It is most useful forpaths between 250 km and 6000 km, but can be used
  with reduced accuracyfor paths shorter or longer than this.The command
  uses a routine MINIMUF 3.5 developed by the U.S. Navy andused to
  predict the MUF given the predicted flux, day of the year,hour of the
  day and geographic coordinates of the transmitter andreceiver. This
  routine is reasonably accurate for the purposes here,with a claimed
  RMS error of 3.8 MHz, but much smaller and less complexthan the
  programs used by major shortwave broadcasting organizations,such as
  the Voice of America.The command will display some header information
  detailing itsassumptions, together with the locations, latitude and
  longitudes andbearings. It will then show UTC (UT), local time at the
  other end(LT), calculate the MUFs, Sun zenith angle at the midpoint of
  the path(Zen) and the likely signal strengths. Then for each frequency
  for whichthe system thinks there is a likelihood of a circuit it
  prints a value.The value is currently a likely S meter reading based
  on the conventional6dB / S point scale. If the value has a '+'
  appended it means that it is1/2 an S point stronger. If the value is
  preceeded by an 'm' it means thatthere is likely to be much fading and
  by an 's' that the signal is likelyto be noisy.  By default SHOW/MUF
  will show the next two hours worth of data. Youcan specify anything up
  to 24 hours worth of data by appending the no ofhours required after
  the prefix. For example:-


         SH/MUF W



  produces:


         RxSens: -123 dBM SFI: 159   R: 193   Month: 10   Day: 21  Power :   20 dBW    Distance:  6283 km    Delay: 22.4 ms  Location                       Lat / Long           Azim  East Dereham, Norfolk          52 41 N 0 57 E         47  United-States-W                43 0 N 87 54 W        299  UT LT  MUF Zen  1.8  3.5  7.0 10.1 14.0 18.1 21.0 24.9 28.0 50.0  18 23 11.5 -35  mS0+ mS2   S3  19  0 11.2 -41  mS0+ mS2   S3



  indicating that you will have weak, fading circuits on top band and
  80m but usable signals on 40m (about S3).inputing:-


         SH/MUF W 24



  will get you the above display, but with the next 24 hours worth
  ofpropagation data.


         SH/MUF W L 24  SH/MUF W 24 Long



  Gives you an estimate of the long path propagation characterics.
  Itshould be noted that the figures will probably not be very useful,
  norterrible accurate, but it is included for completeness.

  11.224.  sysop (0)

  sysop Regain your privileges if you login remotely

  The system automatically reduces your privilege level to that of
  anormal user if you login in remotely. This command allows you
  toregain your normal privilege level. It uses the normal system:
  fivenumbers are returned that are indexes into the character array
  that isyour assigned password (see SET/PASSWORD). The indexes start
  fromzero.You are expected to return a string which contains the
  charactersrequired in the correct order. You may intersperse those
  characterswith others to obscure your reply for any watchers. For
  example (andthese values are for explanation :-):


         password = 012345678901234567890123456789  > sysop  22 10 15 17 3



  you type:-


        aa2bbbb0ccc5ddd7xxx3n or 2 0 5 7 3 or 20573



  They will all match. If there is no password you will still be
  offerednumbers but nothing will happen when you input a string. Any
  match iscase sensitive.

  11.225.  talk <call> > <node> [<text>] (0)

  talk <call> > <node> [<text>] Send a text message to another station
  via a node

  Send a short message to any other station that is visible on the
  clustersystem. You can send it to anyone you can see with a
  SHOW/CONFIGURATION command, they don't have to be connected
  locally.The second form of TALK is used when other cluster nodes are
  connectedwith restricted information. This usually means that they
  don't send the user information usually associated with logging on and
  off the cluster.If you know that G3JNB is likely to be present on
  GB7TLH, but you can onlysee GB7TLH in the SH/C list but with no users,
  then you would use thesecond form of the talk message.If you want to
  have a ragchew with someone you can leave the text messageout and the
  system will go into 'Talk' mode. What this means is that ashort
  message is sent to the recipient telling them that you are in
  a'Talking' frame of mind and then you just type - everything you send
  willgo to the station that you asked for. All the usual announcements,
  spots and so on will still come out on yourterminal.If you want to do
  something (such as send a spot) you preceed the normal command with a
  '/' character, eg:-


          /DX 14001 G1TLH What's a B class licensee doing on 20m CW?   /HELP talk



  To leave talk mode type:


          /EX



  If you are in 'Talk' mode, there is an extention to the '/' command
  whichallows you to send the output to all the people you are talking
  to. You do with the '//' command. For example:-


         //sh/hftable



  will send the hftable as you have it to all the people you are cur-
  rently talking to.

  11.226.  talk <call> [<text>] (0)

  talk <call> [<text>] Send a text message to another station


  11.227.  type <filearea>/<name> (0)

  type <filearea>/<name> Look at the contents of a file in one of the
  fileareas

  Type out the contents of a file in a filearea. So, for example, in
  filearea 'bulletins' you want to look at file 'arld051' you would
  enter:-


          TYPE bulletins/arld051



  See also SHOW/FILES to see what fileareas are available and a list of
  content.

  11.228.  uncatchup <node call> all|[msgno> ...] (5)

  uncatchup <node call> all|[msgno> ...] Unmark a message as sent


  When you send messages the fact that you have forwarded it to another
  node is remembered so that it isn't sent again. When you have a new
  partnernode and you add their callsign to your /spider/msg/forward.pl
  file, alloutstanding non-private messages will be forwarded to them.
  This may wellbe ALL the non-private messages. You can prevent this by
  using these commmands:-


         catchup GB7DJK all  catchup GB7DJK 300 301 302 303 500-510



  and to undo what you have just done:-


         uncatchup GB7DJK all  uncatchup GB7DJK 300 301 302 303 500-510



  which will arrange for them to be forward candidates again.Order is
  not important.

  11.229.  unset/announce (0)

  unset/announce Stop announce messages coming out on your terminal


  11.230.  unset/anntalk (0)

  unset/anntalk Stop talk like announce messages on your terminal

  The announce system on legacy cluster nodes is used as a talk
  substitute because the network is so poorly connected. If you:


         unset/anntalk



  you will suppress several of these announces, you may miss the odd
  useful one as well, but you would probably miss them anyway in thewel-
  ter of useless ones.


         set/anntalk



  allows you to see them again. This is the default.

  11.231.  unset/baddx <call>.. (8)

  unset/baddx <call>.. Propagate a dx spot with this callsign again

  Setting a word as 'baddx' will prevent spots with that word in
  the'spotted' field (as in: DX 14001.1 FR0G)of a DX spot from going
  anyfurther. They will not be displayed and they will not be sent
  ontoother nodes.The word must be written in full, no wild cards are
  allowed eg:-


         set/baddx FORSALE VIDEO FR0G



  To allow a word again, use the following command ...


         unset/baddx VIDEO



  11.232.  unset/badnode <call>.. (8)

  unset/badnode <call>.. Allow spots from this node again

  going any further. They will not be displayed and they will not be
  sent onto other nodes.The call must be a full eg:-


         set/badnode K1TTT



  will stop anything from K1TTT. If you want SSIDs as well then you mus-
  tenter them specifically.


         unset/badnode K1TTT



  will allow spots from him again.Use with extreme care. This command
  may well be superceeded by FILTERing.

  11.233.  unset/badspotter <call>.. (8)

  unset/badspotter <call>.. Allow spots from this callsign again

  Setting a callsign as a 'badspotter' will prevent spots from this
  callsign going any further. They will not be displayed and they will
  not be sent onto other nodes.The call must be written in full, no wild
  cards are allowed eg:-


         set/badspotter VE2STN



  will stop anything from VE2STN. This command will automaticallystop
  spots from this user, regardless of whether or which SSID he uses. DO
  NOT USE SSIDs in the callsign, just use the callsignas above or below.


         unset/badspotter VE2STN



  will allow spots from him again.Use with extreme care. This command
  may well be superceded by FILTERing.

  11.234.  unset/badword <word>.. (8)

  unset/badword <word>.. Propagate things with this word again

  Setting a word as a 'badword' will prevent things like spots,announces
  or talks with this word in the the text part from going anyfurther.
  They will not be displayed and they will not be sent ontoother
  nodes.The word must be written in full, no wild cards are allowed eg:-
         set/badword annihilate annihilated annihilation



  will stop anything with these words in the text.


         unset/badword annihilated



  will allow text with this word again.

  A standard feature which is enabled in version 1.43 and above is that
  if the spotter's grid square is known it is output on the endof a DX
  announcement (there is just enough room). Some user programscannot
  cope with this. You can use this command to reset (or set)this
  feature.Conflicts with: SET/DXCQ, SET/DXITUDo a STAT/USER to see which
  flags you have set if you are confused.

  11.240.  unset/dxitu (0)

  DO NOT NEED TO USE THIS COMMAND IF YOU ARE CONNECTED VIA AX25.

  11.242.  unset/email (0)

  unset/email Stop personal msgs being forwarded by email

  If any personal messages come in for your callsign then you can
  usethese commands to control whether they are forwarded onto your
  emailaddress. To enable the forwarding do something like:-


         SET/EMAIL mike.tubby@somewhere.com



  You can have more than one email address (each one separated by a
  space).Emails are forwarded to all the email addresses you specify.You
  can disable forwarding by:-


         UNSET/EMAIL



  11.243.  unset/here (0)

  Registration is a concept that you can switch on by executing the


         set/var $main::regreq = 1



  command (usually in your startup file)If a user is NOT registered
  then, firstly, instead of the normalmotd file (/spider/data/motd)
  being sent to the user at startup, theuser is sent the motd_nor file
  instead. Secondly, the non registereduser only has READ-ONLY access to

  spotted's State will appear on the LHS of thetime field. Any
  information found will override any locator information from
  SET/DXGRID.Some user programs cannot cope with this. You can use this
