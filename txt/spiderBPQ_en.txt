This is the first experimental version of a BPQ32 interface for
dx-spider. The document assumes the reader is familiar with both
spider and BPQ32.

I have only tested it with ActiveState Perl v 5.8.7 Build 813

You need to install package Win32::API. I downloaded it from:

http://ppm.activestate.com/PPMPackages/zips/8xx-builds-only/Windows/Win32-API-0.41.zip


Copy \spider\perl\BPQConnect.pm to the \spider\local directory

The following bit about bpqperl.dll is NOT neaded if you are using the
Latest (409u) BPQ32.

copy bpqperl.dll to your windows directory. I had problems with
WIN32::API calling the GetData routine of the BPQ API, so had to
create this 'glue' routine. Hopefully I can solve the problem and get
rid of this extra routine soon.

Edit BPQConnect.pm as appropriate - you may need to change ApplMask and BPQStreams.

Although running spider will dynamically load BPQ32 if it is not
already running, it seems to function very slowly. I suggest you load
BPQ32 before starting spider. If you are already running any other bpq
applications thats fine, otherwise run bpq32.exe, or better still
bpqterminal, so you can monitor what is going on.

Outward connects to other clusters seems to work, although I've only
been able to test it with a very old DOS based AK1A system. See sample
connect script below:

Use command set/debug bpq from a sysop session to enable extra debug output

timeout 120
abort Downlink|Fail
# the '1' is for compatibility with agw and is ignored
connect bpq 1 switch
'BPQ:GM8BPQ' 'c gb7bpq'
'connected ''
# you can leave this out if you call the script 'gb7bpq'
client gb7bpq bpq

Remember this is very much 'alpha' software!

Any problems/suggestions, feel free to contact me.
