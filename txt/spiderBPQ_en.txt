This is the first experimental version of a BPQ32 interface for
dx-spider. The document assumes the reader is familiar with both
spider and BPQ32.

I have only tested it with ActiveState Perl v 5.8.7 Build 813

You need to install package Win32::API. I downloaded it from:

http://ppm.activestate.com/PPMPackages/zips/8xx-builds-only/Windows/Win32-API-0.41.zip

Or, better yet, use ppm to install it for you:

ppm install Win32-API

Copy \spider\perl\BPQConnect.pm to the \spider\local directory

Edit BPQConnect.pm as appropriate - you may need to change ApplMask
and BPQStreams.

Although running spider will dynamically load BPQ32 if it is not
already running, it does not function correctly. I suggest you load
BPQ32 before starting spider. If you are already running any other bpq
applications thats fine, otherwise run bpq32.exe, or better still
bpqterminal, so you can monitor what is going on.

Outward connects to other clusters seems to work, although I've only
been able to test it with a very old DOS based AK1A system. See sample
connect script below:

Use command "set/debug bpq" from a sysop session to enable extra debug
output.

Remember this is very much 'alpha' software!

Any problems/suggestions, feel free to contact me.

Sample connect script:

timeout 120
abort Downlink|Fail
# the '1' is for compatibility with agw and is ignored
connect bpq 1 switch
'BPQ:GM8BPQ' 'c gb7bpq'
'connected ''
# you can leave this next line out if you call the script 'gb7bpq'
client gb7bpq bpq
