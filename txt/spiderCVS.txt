  The DXSpider CVS Changes addendum
  Ian Maude, G0VGS, (ianmaude@btinternet.com)
  Version 0.1 March 2001

  A reference for CVS users of the DXSpider DXCluster program.

  If you have any problems with a new CVS version please mail the
  support list or come and report on WW Convers channel 9000 or from a
  44 host to sys2.pa4ab.ampr.org (44.137.44.16) port 6667 (IRC) and join
  #9000.


  The latest CVS is version 1.47.  There are major changes going on
  currently as the code is altered to allow DXSpider to be run under
  Microsoft Windows.

  There is a separate file for the Windows installation in the
  /spider/html and /spider/txt directories so I will not include that
  here.

  For Linux users, there are several steps to complete to update from
  version 1.46.

  PLEASE READ ALL THE FOLLOWING BEFORE STARTING


  +o  tar up your existing perl and cmd directories and put them
     somewhere safe so you can revert to the old version if necessary.

  +o  Do a CVS update in the normal way (cvs update -d)

  +o  cp /spider/perl/Listeners.pm to /spider/local and edit it as below

  +o  comment out the spdlogin line in inetd.conf and 'killall -HUP
     inetd'

  +o  "make" the client in /spider/src (just in case it has changed)

  +o  restart the cluster and pray :-)

  The Listeners.pm file looks something like this ...



       #
       # Copy this file to /spider/local and modify it to your requirements
       #
       #
       # This file specifies which local interfaces and ports you will be
       # listening on
       #
       # You can add as many as you like
       #

       package main;

       use vars qw(@listen);

       @listen = (
       #                  ["localhost", 7300],
       #                  ["foo.dxcluster.net", 7300],
                         );

       1;


  Alter the hostnames and ports to reflect you setup.  This file is only
  used for incoming telnet requests.  You do not have to use hostnames,
  it is quite ok to use IP addresses and it is also a matter of choice
  whether or not you add the domain.

  Here is an example of a working Listeners.pm file ..



       @listen = (
                          ["localhost", 8000],
                          ["sys2", 8000],
                          ["apu", 8000],
                         );




  Now all this is well and good if you have a static IP address.  If
  your IP address is dynamic then one line will do, like this ...



       @listen = (
                          ["0.0.0.0", 8000],
                         );




  From this version, the file client.pl has ceased to be needed.  In
  fact it has been removed.  If you are still using client.pl in your
  ax25d.conf then replace it with /spider/src/client.
