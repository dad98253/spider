  [1m1.  Installation[0m

  [1m1.1.  Where do I get DXSpider?[0m

  All things Spider can be found at www.dxcluster.org and the actual
  program and patches can be found in the download area.


  [1m1.2.  How do I use the patches?[0m

  Patching is done in the standard linux way ...



       zcat /tmp/patch-1.40 | patch -p0



  assuming the patch version you are using is 1.40 and resides in /tmp!


  Be aware that each patch assumes the previous patch has been applied.
  That is to say if you are patching from version 1.38 to 1.40 you would
  first need to apply patch-1.39 and then patch-1.40.



  [1m1.3.  If I use a tarball to overwrite my installation, what happens to[0m
  [1mmy configuration?[0m

  The tarballs are designed to not overwrite your existing configuration
  and can be used at any time to update your Spider software.  All the
  key files have the suffix .issue (eg. DXVars.pm.issue) at default.


  [1m1.4.  I am running RedHat 5.2 and I am getting strange errors, what is[0m
  [1mwrong?[0m

  The version of Perl that comes with 5.2 seems to be some kind of pre-
  release and is broken.  You can get a new version of perl from
  www.dxcluster.org or ftp://updates.redhat.com.  Don't forget to patch
  it with the CPAN modules.


  [1m2.  Administration[0m

  [1m2.1.  How can I get Spider to restart automatically if it crashes?[0m

  Put this line into /etc/inittab ..



       DX:3:respawn:/bin/su -c "/usr/bin/perl -w /spider/perl/cluster.pl" sysop > /dev/tty7



  Run [4mtelinit[24m [4mq[24m as root.  Spider will restart so be aware.  However, any
  time you reboot, cluster.pl will start in tty7 and if it crashes, it
  should restart ok.


  [1m2.2.  How can I monitor traffic to and from a node or user?[0m

  There are 2 ways to achieve this.  You can use the [4mtail[24m command like
  this ..



       tail -f /spider/data/debug/167.dat |grep G0VGS



  or in later versions of Spider, there is a command called [4mwatchdbg[24m in
  which case you simply type ..



       watchdbg G0VGS



  [1m2.3.  I see spots coming in my debug log, but none go out to the users[0m

  Please check the time on your PC.


  All spots are checked that they are no more than 15 minutes in the
  future and 60 minutes in the past. If your clock on your client prompt
  (or console.pl display) is not set to the correct time in GMT (UTC)
  and is more than one hour out (say on your local (summer) time) then
  the test will fail and no spots will come out. Neither will they be
  stored.


  If you are connected to the internet, most linux distributions have an
  implementation of ntpd. The Microsoft Windows 2003, XP, 2000 and NT
  machine clock can also be set to be syncronised to an NTP source.
  This can be done in the standard time configuration screen. There is
  also the simple nettime program for Windows 95/98/ME.



  [1m2.4.  My neighbouring node cannot use the RCMD command to me, he just[0m
  [1mkeeps getting the "tut tut" message.[0m

  Assuming that the permissions are set correctly (perm level 5
  required), it could be that the home_node is set incorrectly.  You can
  reset the home_node using the [4mspoof[24m command like this ..



       spoof gb7adx set/home gb7adx



  Assuming that the node_call you are changing is gb7adx.


  [1m2.5.  I do not seem to be sending any bulletin mail to my link part-[0m
  [1mners, what is wrong?[0m

  There is a file in /spider/msg called forward.pl.issue.  Rename this
  to forward.pl and edit it to meet your requirements.  You will need to
  issue the command [4mload/forward[24m or restart Spider for the changes to
  take effect.


  [1m2.6.  How can I automatically limit the amount of debug logfiles that[0m
  [1mare stored?[0m

  Use the tmpwatch command.  Create a file in /etc/cron.daily/
  containing the line ...



       /usr/sbin/tmpwatch -f 240 /spider/data/debug



  Remember to make it executable!

  This will limit your debug data down to the last 10 days.

  However, modern versions of DXSpider will do this for you, so this is
  now probably unnecessary.


  [1m2.7.  I updated my Linux distribution and now Spider cannot read the[0m
  [1musers file or the dupefile, what is the problem?[0m

  Almost certainly this is a change in the db format of perl.  Follow
  these few steps to correct the problem.

  o  stop the cluster (disable any autostart in inittab)

  o  cd /spider/data

  o  issue the command: perl user_asc

  o  restart the cluster

  That should solve the problem.


  [1m2.8.  Since I last updated I seem to be getting duplicate spots[0m
  [1mappearing.[0m

  What has probably happened is that the dupefile has got corrupted in
  some way.  Simply delete the /spider/data/dupefile and restart the
  cluster.  It may take a little time to become fully functional but
  should solve your problem.


  [1m2.9.  I have deleted a message but it is still there, why?[0m

  This is now the way messages are handled for deletion in Spider.  If
  you look closely you will see a 'D' following the message number.
  This message is marked for deletion and will be deleted in 2 days if
  nothing further is done.  Optionally you can use the command
  [4mdelete/expunge[24m to delete it immediately.


  [1m2.10.  I have updated from CVS and I get all sorts of errors when I[0m
  [1mrestart[0m

  Whenever you update from CVS, a log is displayed. Next to each file
  that is downloaded there is a letter, e.g.:



       ? fred.pl
       ? jim
       ..
       .
       ..
       cvs server: Updating perl
       P cluster.pl
       C Messages
       M Internet.pm
       U DXProt.pm
       ..
       .
       ..



  For normal CVS use you should only ever see the letters 'P', 'U' or
  '?'. The letter 'P' means that the file has changed in CVS and is more
  recent than the one that is currently on your system. You will also
  see the letter '?', which means that there is a file that you (or the
  system) has created that CVS doesn't know about and isn't under its
  control. These are all normal and good.


  Sometimes you will see the letter 'U' next to a file. This means that
  it is a new file that you don't currently have. This is also OK.

  However, if you see the letter 'C' or 'M', that means that CVS thinks
  that the file has changed locally. For the letter 'C', it has changed
  sufficiently near to one or more modifications which CVS wants to
  download to your system. For the 'M', CVS thinks that it is OK to make
  the change (you may also see some messages about "merging revision
  1.xx with 1.yy").  Neither of these things are good. Files that are
  under the control of CVS must not be changed by sysops. It is the
  files that have the 'C' next to them that will show the errors that
  you are complaining about and they will be things like:-



       Syntax error near '<<<<' at line 23
       Syntax error near '===' at line 40
       Syntax error near '>>>' at line 51



  You will not necessarily see all of the errors shown but you will get
  one or more sets of some of them. The cure is simple:


  o  identify the file that is causing the problem.

  o  remove the file.

  o  run the cvs update again.


  You will see that file come back (with a letter 'U' next to it). That
  will be the correct file as CVS thinks it should be. If you [4mstill[24m have
  a problem, then get onto the dxspider-support mailing list.


  If all else fails (or you have several conflicts) you can safely
  remove the entire /spider/perl and /spider/cmd directories and then
  run the cvs update. They will all be recreated in their pristine
  condition.


  [1m2.11.  I have done a CVS update, restarted and it says that "fileX" is[0m
  [1mmissing[0m

  The correct way to run cvs is:-



       cd /spider
       cvs -z3 update -d



  The '-d' is crucial. It makes sure that any new directories, that may
  contain new code, are created and that new code downloaded. I have
  absolutely no idea why this is not the default, seeing as CVS (in
  other circumstances) happily recurses its merry way down a directory
  tree, but there you are.


  WinCVS and other graphical CVS frontends have a checkbox for the
  update screen called something like "create sub-directories" (it may
  be hidden in some sub-screen - go look for it if it isn't obvious).
  Make sure that this box is checked. If you can make this the default
  setting in the program's setup screen then please do that. It will
  save you a lot of pulled hair.
